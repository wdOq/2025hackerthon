      "text": "ANNEX I GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR ASSESSING SUBSTANCES AND PREPARING CHEMICAL SAFETY REPORTS GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR ASSESSING SUBSTANCES AND PREPARING CHEMICAL SAFETY REPORTS 0. INTRODUCTION ▼M51 0.1. The purpose of this Annex is to set out how manufacturers and importers are to assess and document that the risks arising from the substance they manufacture or import are adequately controlled during manufacture and their own use(s) and that others further down the supply chain can adequately control the risks. The chemical safety report shall also describe whether and which different nanoforms of substances as characterised in Annex VI are manufactured and imported, including an adequate justification for each information requirement describing when and how information on one form is used to demonstrate safety of other forms. The requirements speof the following hazard classes or categories setcific to nanoforms of a substance in this Annex apply to all nanoforms covered by the registration and without prejudice to requirements applicable to other forms of that substance. This Annex shall also apply adapted as necessary to producers and importers of articles required to make a chemical safety assessment as part of a registration. ▼C1 0.2. The chemical safety assessment shall be prepared by one or more competent person(s) who have appropriate experience and received appropriate training, including refresher training. ▼M51 0.3. The chemical safety assessment of a manufacturer shall address the manufacture of a substance and all the identified uses. The chemical safety assessment of an importer shall address all identified uses. The chemical safety assessment shall consider the use of the substance on its own (including any major impurities and additives), in a mixture and in an article, as defined by the identified uses. The assessment shall consider all stages of the life-cycle of the substance resulting from the manufacture and identified uses. The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration. The justifications and conclusions drawn from the assessment shall be relevant to these nanoforms. The chemical safety assessment shall be based on a comparison of the potential adverse effects of a substance with the known or reasonably foreseeable exposure of man and/or the environment to that substance taking into account implemented and recommended risk management measures and operational conditions. 0.4. Substances whose physicochemical, toxicological and eco-toxicological properties are likely to be similar or follow a regular pattern as a result of structural similarity may be considered as a group, or ‘category’ of substances. If the manufacturer or importer considers that the chemical safety assessment carried out for one substance is sufficient to assess and document that the risks arising from another substance or from a group or ‘category’ of substances are adequately controlled then he can use that chemical safety assessment for the other substance or group or ‘category’ of substances. The manufacturer or importer shall provide a justification for this. Where any of the substances exists in one or more nanoforms and data from one form are used in demonstration of the safe use of other forms, in accordance with the general rules set out in Annex XI, a scientific justification shall be given on how, applying the rules for grouping and read-across, the data from a specific test or other information (e.g. methods, results or conclusions) can be used for the other forms of the substance. Similar considerations apply to exposure scenarios and risk management measures. ▼C1 0.5. The chemical safety assessment shall be based on the information on the substance contained in the technical dossier and on other available and relevant information. Manufacturers or importers submitting a proposal for testing in accordance with Annexes IX and X shall record this under the relevant heading of the chemical safety report. Available information from assessments carried out under other international and national programmes shall be included. Where available and appropriate, an assessment carried out under Community legislation (e.g. risk assessments completed under Regulation (EEC) No 793/93) shall be taken into account in the development of, and reflected in, the chemical safety report. Deviations from such assessments shall be justified. Thus the information to be considered includes information related to the hazards of the substance, the exposure arising from the manufacture or import, the identified uses of the substance, operational conditions and risk management measures applied or recommended to downstream users to be taken into account. In accordance with section 3 of Annex XI in some cases, it may not be necessary to generate missing information, because risk management measures and operational conditions which are necessary to control a well-characterised risk may also be sufficient to control other potential risks, which will not therefore need to be characterised precisely. ▼M51 If the manufacturer or importer considers that further information is necessary for producing his chemical safety report and that this information can only be obtained by performing tests in accordance with Annex IX or X, he shall submit a proposal for a testing strategy, explaining why he considers that additional information is necessary and record this in the chemical safety report under the appropriate heading. Where considered necessary, the proposal for a testing strategy may concern several studies addressing respectively different forms of the same substance for the same information requirement. While waiting for results of further testing, he shall record in his chemical safety report, and include in the exposure scenario developed, the interim risk management measures that he has put in place and those he recommends to downstream users intended to manage the risks being explored. The exposure scenarios and interim risk management measures recommended shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration. ▼M10 0.6. Steps of a chemical safety assessment 0.6.1. A chemical safety assessment performed by a manufacturer or an importer for a substance shall include the following steps 1 to 4 in accordance with the respective sections of this Annex: 1. Human health hazard assessment. 2. Human health hazard assessment of physicochemical properties. 3. Environmental hazard assessment. 4. PBT and vPvB assessment. 0.6.2. In the cases referred to in point 0.6.3 the chemical safety assessment shall also include the following steps 5 and 6 in accordance with Sections 5 and 6 of this Annex: 5. Exposure assessment. 5.1. The generation of exposure scenario(s) (or the identification of relevant use and exposure categories, if appropriate). 5.2. Exposure estimation. 6. Risk characterisation. ▼M51 0.6.3. Where as a result of steps 1 to 4 the manufacturer or importer concludes that the substance or, when applicable, nanoforms thereof fulfils the criteria for any of the following hazard classes or categories set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 or is assessed to be a PBT or vPvB, the chemical safety assessment shall also include steps 5 and 6 in accordance with Sections 5 and 6 of this Annex: (a) hazard classes 2.1 to 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7, 2.8 types A and B, 2.9, 2.10, 2.12, 2.13 categories 1 and 2, 2.14 categories 1 and 2, and 2.15 types A to F; (b) hazard classes 3.1 to 3.6, 3.7 adverse effects on sexual function and fertility or on development, 3.8 effects other than narcotic effects, 3.9, and 3.10; (c) hazard class 4.1; (d) hazard class 5.1. ▼M10 0.6.4. A summary of all the relevant information used in addressing the points above shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report (Section 7). ▼C1 0.7. The main element of the exposure part of the chemical safety report is the description of the exposure scenario(s) implemented for the manufacturer's production, the manufacturer or importer's own use, and those recommended by the manufacturer or importer to be implemented for the identified use(s). An exposure scenario is the set of conditions that describe how the substance is manufactured or used during its life-cycle and how the manufacturer or importer controls, or recommends downstream users to control, exposures of humans and the environment. These sets of conditions contain a description of both the risk management measures and operational conditions which the manufacturer or importer has implemented or recommends to be implemented by downstream users. If the substance is placed on the market, the relevant exposure scenario(s), including the risk management measures and operational conditions shall be included in an annex to the safety data sheet in accordance with Annex II. 0.8. The level of detail required in describing an exposure scenario will vary substantially from case to case, depending on the use of a substance, its hazardous properties and the amount of information available to the manufacturer or importer. Exposure scenarios may describe the appropriate risk management measures for several individual processes or uses of a substance. An exposure scenario may thereby cover a large range of processes or uses. Exposure scenarios covering a wide range of processes or uses may be referred to as Exposure Categories. Further mention of Exposure Scenario in this Annex and Annex II includes Exposure Categories if they are developed. 0.9. Where information is not necessary in accordance with Annex XI, this fact shall be stated under the appropriate heading of the chemical safety report and a reference shall be made to the justification in the technical dossier. The fact that no information is required shall also be stated in the safety data sheet. 0.10. In relation to particular effects, such as ozone depletion, photochemical ozone creation potential, strong odour and tainting, for which the procedures set out in Sections 1 to 6 are impracticable, the risks associated with such effects shall be assessed on a case-by-case basis and the manufacturer or importer shall include a full description and justification of such assessments in the chemical safety report and summarised in the safety data sheet. 0.11. When assessing the risk of the use of one or more substances incorporated into a special ►M3 mixture ◄ (for instance alloys), the way the constituent substances are bonded in the chemical matrix shall be taken into account. ▼M51 0.11. bis When nanoforms are covered by the chemical safety assessment, an appropriate metric for the assessment and presentation of the results in steps 1-6 of the chemical safety assessment under 0.6.1 and 0.6.2 shall be considered, with the justification included in the chemical safety report and summarised in the safety data sheet. A multiple metric presentation, including mass metric information, is preferable. When possible, a method for reciprocal conversion shall be indicated. ▼C1 0.12. Where the methodology described in this Annex is not appropriate, details of alternative methodology used shall be explained and justified in the chemical safety report. 0.13. Part A of the chemical safety report shall include a declaration that the risk management measures outlined in the relevant exposure scenarios for the manufacturer's or importer's own use(s) are implemented by the manufacturer or importer and that those exposure scenarios for the identified uses are communicated to distributors and downstream users in the safety data sheet(s). 1. HUMAN HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT 1.0. Introduction ▼M10 1.0.1. The objectives of the human health hazard assessment shall be to determine the classification of a substance in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008; and to derive levels of exposure to the substance above which humans should not be exposed. This level of exposure is known as the Derived No-Effect Level (DNEL). 1.0.2. The human health hazard assessment shall consider the toxicokinetic profile (i.e. absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination) of the substance and the following groups of effects: (1) acute effects such as acute toxicity, irritation and corrosivity; (2) sensitisation; (3) repeated dose toxicity; and (4) CMR effects (carcinogenity, germ cell mutagenicity and toxicity for reproduction). Based on all the available information, other effects shall be considered when necessary. ▼C1 1.0.3. The hazard assessment shall comprise the following four steps: Step 1 : Evaluation of non-human information. Step 2 : Evaluation of human information. Step 3 : Classification and Labelling. Step 4 : Derivation of DNELs. ▼M51 The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration. ▼C1 1.0.4. The first three steps shall be undertaken for every effect for which information is available and shall be recorded under the relevant section of the Chemical Safety Report and where required and in accordance with Article 31, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under headings 2 and 11. 1.0.5. For any effect for which no relevant information is available, the relevant section shall contain the sentence: ‘This information is not available’. The justification, including reference to any literature search carried out, shall be included in the technical dossier. 1.0.6. Step 4 of the human health hazard assessment shall be undertaken by integrating the results from the first three steps and shall be included under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report and summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under heading 8.1. 1.1. Step 1 : Evaluation of non-human information 1.1.1. The evaluation of non-human information shall comprise: — the hazard identification for the effect based on all available non-human information, — the establishment of the quantitative dose (concentration)-response (effect) relationship. 1.1.2. When it is not possible to establish the quantitative dose (concentration)-response (effect) relationship, then this should be justified and a semi-quantitative or qualitative analysis shall be included. For instance, for acute effects it is usually not possible to establish the quantitative dose (concentration)-response (effect) relationship on the basis of the results of a test conducted in accordance with test methods laid down in a Commission Regulation as specified in Article 13(3). In such cases it suffices to determine whether and to which degree the substance has an inherent capacity to cause the effect. ▼M10 1.1.3. All non-human information used to assess a particular effect on humans and to establish the dose (concentration) – response (effect) relationship, shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or tables, distinguishing between in vitro , in vivo and other information. The relevant test results (e.g. ATE, LD50, NO(A)EL or LO(A)EL) and test conditions (e.g. test duration, route of administration) and other relevant information shall be presented, in internationally recognised units of measurement for that effect. ▼C1 1.1.4. If one study is available then a robust study summary should be prepared for that study. If there are several studies addressing the same effect, then, having taken into account possible variables (e.g. conduct, adequacy, relevance of test species, quality of results, etc.), normally the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern shall be used to establish the DNELs and a robust study summary shall be prepared for that study or studies and included as part of the technical dossier. Robust summaries will be required of all key data used in the hazard assessment. If the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern are not used, then this shall be fully justified and included as part of the technical dossier, not only for the study being used but also for all studies demonstrating a higher concern than the study being used. It is important irrespective of whether hazards have been identified or not that the validity of the study be considered. 1.2. Step 2 : Evaluation of human information If no human information is available, this part shall contain the statement: ‘No human information is available’. However, if human information is available, it shall be presented, if possible in the form of a table. 1.3. Step 3 : Classification and Labelling ▼M10 1.3.1. The appropriate classification developed in accordance with the criteria in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be presented and justified. Where applicable, Specific Concentration limits resulting from the application of Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and Articles 4 to 7 of Directive 1999/45/EC shall be presented and, if they are not included in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, justified. ▼M51 The assessment should always include a statement as to whether the substance or, when applicable, nanoforms thereof fulfils or does not fulfil the criteria given in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 for classification in the hazard class carcinogenicity category 1A or 1B, in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity category 1A or 1B or in the hazard class reproductive toxicity category 1A or 1B. 1.3.2. If the information is inadequate to decide whether a substance or, when applicable, nanoforms thereof should be classified for a particular hazard class or category, the registrants shall indicate and justify the action or decision he has taken as a result. ▼C1 1.4. Step 4 : Identification of DNEL(s) 1.4.1. Based on the outcomes of steps 1 and 2, (a) DNEL(s) shall be established for the substance, reflecting the likely route(s), duration and frequency of exposure. ►M10 For some hazard classes, especially germ cell mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, the available information may not enable a toxicological threshold, and therefore a DNEL, to be established. ◄ If justified by the exposure scenario(s), a single DNEL may be sufficient. However, taking into account the available information and the exposure scenario(s) in Section 9 of the Chemical Safety Report it may be necessary to identify different DNELs for each relevant human population (e.g. workers, consumers and humans liable to exposure indirectly via the environment) and possibly for certain vulnerable sub-populations (e.g. children, pregnant women) and for different routes of exposure. A full justification shall be given specifying, inter alia , the choice of the information used, the route of exposure (oral, dermal, inhalation) and the duration and frequency of exposure to the substance for which the DNEL is valid. If more than one route of exposure is likely to occur, then a DNEL shall be established for each route of exposure and for the exposure from all routes combined. When establishing the DNEL, the following factors shall, inter alia , be taken into account: (a) the uncertainty arising, among other factors, from the variability in the experimental information and from intra- and inter-species variation; (b) the nature and severity of the effect; (c) the sensitivity of the human (sub-)population to which the quantitative and/or qualitative information on exposure applies. 1.4.2. If it is not possible to identify a DNEL, then this shall be clearly stated and fully justified. 2. PHYSICOCHEMICAL HAZARD ASSESSMENT ▼M10 2.1. The objective of the hazard assessment for physicochemical properties shall be to determine the classification of a substance in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. 2.2. As a minimum, the potential effects to human health shall be assessed for the following physicochemical properties: — explosivity, — flammability, — oxidising potential. ▼M51 If the information is inadequate to decide whether a substance or, when applicable, nanoforms thereof should be classified for a particular hazard class or category, the registrant shall indicate and justify the action or decision he has taken as a result. ▼C1 2.3. The assessment of each effect shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report (Section 7) and where required and in accordance with Article 31, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under headings 2 and 9. 2.4. For every physicochemical property, the assessment shall entail an evaluation of the inherent capacity of the substance to cause the effect resulting from the manufacture and identified uses. ▼M10 2.5. The appropriate classification developed in accordance with the criteria in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be presented and justified. ▼C1 3. ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD ASSESSMENT 3.0. Introduction ▼M10 3.0.1. The objective of the environmental hazard assessment shall be to determine the classification of a substance in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and to identify the concentration of the substance below which adverse effects in the environmental sphere of concern are not expected to occur. This concentration is known as the Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC). ▼C1 3.0.2. The environmental hazard assessment shall consider the potential effects on the environment, comprising the (1) aquatic (including sediment), (2) terrestrial and (3) atmospheric compartments, including the potential effects that may occur (4) via food-chain accumulation. In addition, the potential effects on the (5) microbiological activity of sewage treatment systems shall be considered. The assessment of the effects on each of these five environmental spheres shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report (Section 7) and where required and in accordance with Article 31, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under headings 2 and 12. ►M51 The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration. ◄ 3.0.3. For any environmental sphere, for which no effect information is available, the relevant section of the chemical safety report shall contain the sentence: ‘This information is not available’. The justification, including reference to any literature research carried out, shall be included in the technical dossier. For any environmental sphere for which information is available, but the manufacturer or importer believes that it is not necessary to conduct the hazard assessment, the manufacturer or importer shall present a justification, with reference to pertinent information, under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report (Section 7) and where required and in accordance with Article 31, summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under heading 12. 3.0.4. The hazard assessment shall comprise the following three steps, which shall be clearly identified as such in the Chemical Safety Report: Step 1 : Evaluation of information. Step 2 : Classification and Labelling. Step 3 : Derivation of the PNEC. 3.1. Step 1 : Evaluation of information 3.1.1. The evaluation of all available information shall comprise: — the hazard identification based on all available information, — the establishment of the quantitative dose (concentration)-response (effect) relationship. 3.1.2. When it is not possible to establish the quantitative dose (concentration)-response (effect) relationship, then this should be justified and a semi-quantitative or qualitative analysis shall be included. 3.1.3. All information used to assess the effects on a specific environmental sphere shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or tables. The relevant test results (e.g. LC50 or NOEC) and test conditions (e.g. test duration, route of administration) and other relevant information shall be presented, in internationally recognised units of measurement for that effect. 3.1.4. All information used to assess the environmental fate of the substance shall be briefly presented, if possible in the form of a table or tables. The relevant test results and test conditions and other relevant information shall be presented, in internationally recognised units of measurement for that effect. 3.1.5. If one study is available then a robust study summary should be prepared for that study. Where there is more than one study addressing the same effect, then the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern shall be used to draw a conclusion and a robust study summary shall be prepared for that study or studies and included as part of the technical dossier. Robust summaries will be required of all key data used in the hazard assessment. If the study or studies giving rise to the highest concern are not used, then this shall be fully justified and included as part of the technical dossier, not only for the study being used but also for all studies reaching a higher concern than the study being used. For substances where all available studies indicate no hazards an overall assessment of the validity of all studies should be performed. 3.2. Step 2 : Classification and Labelling ▼M51 3.2.1. The appropriate classification developed in accordance with the criteria in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be presented and justified. Any M-factor resulting from the application of Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be presented and, if it is not included in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, justified. The presentation and justification is applied to all nanoforms covered by the registration. 3.2.2. If the information is inadequate to decide whether a substance or, when applicable, nanoforms thereof should be classified for a particular hazard class or category, the registrant shall indicate and justify the action or decision he has taken as a result. ▼C1 3.3. Step 3 : Identification of the PNEC 3.3.1. Based on the available information, the PNEC for each environmental sphere shall be established. The PNEC may be calculated by applying an appropriate assessment factor to the effect values (e.g. LC50 or NOEC). An assessment factor expresses the difference between effects values derived for a limited number of species from laboratory tests and the PNEC for the environmental sphere ( 32 ). 3.3.2. If it is not possible to derive the PNEC, then this shall be clearly stated and fully justified. 4. PBT AND VPVB ASSESSMENT 4.0. Introduction 4.0.1. The objective of the PBT and vPvB assessment shall be to determine if the substance fulfils the criteria given in Annex XIII and if so, to characterise the potential emissions of the substance. A hazard assessment in accordance with Sections 1 and 3 of this Annex addressing all the long-term effects and the estimation of the long-term exposure of humans and the environment as carried out in accordance with Section 5 (Exposure Assessment), step 2 (Exposure Estimation), cannot be carried out with sufficient reliability for substances satisfying the PBT and vPvB criteria in Annex XIII. Therefore, a separate PBT and vPvB assessment is required. ▼M51 4.0.2. The PBT and vPvB assessment shall comprise the following two steps, which shall be clearly identified as such in Part B, Section 8 of the Chemical Safety report. The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration: Step 1 : Comparison with the Criteria. Step 2 : Emission Characterisation. The assessment shall also be summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under heading 12. ▼M10 4.1. Step 1: Comparison with the criteria This part of the PBT and vPvB assessment shall entail the comparison of the available information with the criteria given in Section 1 of Annex XIII and a statement of whether the substance fulfils or does not fulfil the criteria. The assessment shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions laid down in the introductory part of Annex XIII as well as Sections 2 and 3 of that Annex. ▼M51 4.2. Step 2: Emission Characterisation If the substance fulfils the criteria or it is considered as if it is a PBT or vPvB in the registration dossier an emission characterisation shall be conducted comprising the relevant parts of the exposure assessment as described in Section 5. In particular it shall contain an estimation of the amounts of the substance released to the different environmental compartments during all activities carried out by the manufacturer or importer and all identified uses, and an identification of the likely routes by which humans and the environment are exposed to the substance. The estimation shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration. ▼C1 5. EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT 5.0. Introduction ▼M51 The objective of the exposure assessment shall be to make a quantitative and qualitative estimate of the dose/concentration of the substance to which humans and the environment are or may be exposed. The assessment shall consider all stages of the life-cycle of the substance resulting from the manufacture and identified uses and shall cover any exposures that may relate to the hazards identified in Sections 1 to 4. The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration. The exposure assessment shall entail the following two steps, which shall be clearly identified as such in the Chemical Safety Report: ▼C1 Step 1 : Generation of exposure scenario(s) or the generation of relevant use and exposure categories. Step 2 : Exposure Estimation. Where required and in accordance with Article 31, the exposure scenario shall also be included in an annex to the Safety Data Sheet. 5.1. Step 1 : Development of exposure scenarios 5.1.1. Exposure scenarios as described in Sections 0.7 and 0.8 shall be generated. Exposure scenarios are the core of the process to carry out a chemical safety assessment. The chemical safety assessment process may be iterative. The first assessment will be based on the required minimum and all available hazard information and on the exposure estimation that corresponds to the initial assumptions about the operating conditions and risk management measures (an initial exposure scenario). If the initial assumptions lead to a risk characterisation indicating that risks to human health and the environment are not adequately controlled, then it is necessary to carry out an iterative process with amendment of one or a number of factors in hazard or exposure assessment with the aim to demonstrate adequate control. The refinement of hazard assessment may require generation of additional hazard information. The refinement of exposure assessment may involve appropriate alteration of the operational conditions or risk management measures in the exposure scenario or more precise exposure estimation. The exposure scenario, resulting from the final iteration (a final exposure scenario), shall be included in the chemical safety report and attached to the safety data sheet in accordance with Article 31. The final exposure scenario shall be presented under the relevant heading of the chemical safety report, and included in an annex to the safety data sheet, using an appropriate short title giving a brief general description of the use, consistent with those given in Section 3.5 of Annex VI. Exposure scenarios shall cover any manufacture in the Community and all identified uses. In particular, an exposure scenario includes, where relevant, a description of: Operational conditions — the processes involved, including the physical form in which the substance is manufactured, processed and/or used, — the activities of workers related to the processes and the duration and frequency of their exposure to the substance, — the activities of consumers and the duration and frequency of their exposure to the substance, — the duration and frequency of emissions of the substance to the different environmental compartments and sewage treatment systems and the dilution in the receiving environmental compartment. Risk management measures — the risk management measures to reduce or avoid direct and indirect exposure of humans (including workers and consumers) and the different environmental compartments to the substance, — the waste management measures to reduce or avoid exposure of humans and the environment to the substance during waste disposal and/or recycling. 5.1.2. Where a manufacturer, importer or downstream user applies for an application for an authorisation for a specific use, exposure scenarios need only be developed for that use and the subsequent life-cycle steps. 5.2. Step 2 : Exposure Estimation 5.2.1. The exposure shall be estimated for each exposure scenario developed and shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report and where required and in accordance with Article 31, summarised in an annex to the safety data sheet. The exposure estimation entails three elements: (1) emission estimation; (2) assessment of chemical fate and pathways; and (3) estimation of exposure levels. 5.2.2. The emission estimation shall consider the emissions during all relevant parts of the life-cycle of the substance resulting from the manufacture and each of the identified uses. The life-cycle stages resulting from the manufacture of the substance cover, where relevant, the waste stage. The life-cycle stages resulting from identified uses cover, where relevant, the service-life of articles and the waste stage. The emission estimation shall be performed under the assumption that the risk management measures and operational conditions described in the exposure scenario have been implemented. ►M51 When nanoforms are covered by the registration, the emission estimation for these shall, where relevant, take account of situations when the conditions outlined in Annex XI section 3.2 point (c) are fulfilled. ◄ ▼M51 5.2.3. A characterisation of possible degradation, transformation, or reaction processes, and an estimation of environmental distribution and fate shall be performed. When nanoforms are covered by the registration, a characterisation of the dissolution rate, the particle aggregation, the agglomeration and of the particle surface chemistry changes shall be included. ▼C1 5.2.4. An estimation of the exposure levels shall be performed for all human populations (workers, consumers and humans liable to exposure indirectly via the environment) and environmental spheres for which exposure to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable. Each relevant route of human exposure (inhalation, oral, dermal and combined through all relevant routes and sources of exposure) shall be addressed. Such estimations shall take account of spatial and temporal variations in the exposure pattern. In particular, the exposure estimation shall take account of: — adequately measured, representative exposure data, — any major impurities and additives in the substance, — the quantity in which the substance is produced and/or imported, — the quantity for each identified use, — implemented or recommended risk management, including the degree of containment, — duration and frequency of exposure according to the operational conditions, — the activities of workers related to the processes and the duration and frequency of their exposure to the substance, — the activities of consumers and the duration and frequency of their exposure to the substance, — the duration and frequency of emissions of the substance to the different environmental compartments and the dilution in the receiving environmental compartment, — the physicochemical properties of the substance, — transformation and/or degradation products, — the likely routes of exposure of and potential for absorption in humans, — the likely pathways to the environment and environmental distribution and degradation and/or transformation (see also Section 3 Step 1), — scale (geographical) of exposure, — matrix dependent release/migration of the substance. 5.2.5. Where adequately measured representative exposure data are available, special consideration shall be given to them when conducting the exposure assessment. Appropriate models can be used for the estimation of exposure levels. Relevant monitoring data from substances with analogous use and exposure patterns or analogous properties can also be considered. 6. RISK CHARACTERISATION 6.1. The risk characterisation shall be carried out for each exposure scenario and shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report. 6.2. The risk characterisation shall consider the human populations (exposed as workers, consumers or indirectly via the environment and if relevant a combination thereof) and the environmental spheres for which exposure to the substance is known or reasonably foreseeable, under the assumption that the risk management measures described in the exposure scenarios in the Section 5 have been implemented. In addition, the overall environmental risk caused by the substance shall be reviewed by integrating the results for the overall releases, emissions and losses from all sources to all environmental compartments. 6.3. The risk characterisation consists of: — a comparison of the exposure of each human population known to be or likely to be exposed with the appropriate DNEL, — a comparison of the predicted environmental concentrations in each environmental sphere with the PNECs, and — an assessment of the likelihood and severity of an event occurring due to the physicochemical properties of the substance. 6.4. For any exposure scenario, the risk to humans and the environment can be considered to be adequately controlled, throughout the lifecycle of the substance that results from manufacture or identified uses, if: — the exposure levels estimated in Section 6.2 do not exceed the appropriate DNEL or the PNEC, as determined in Sections 1 and 3, respectively, and, — the likelihood and severity of an event occurring due to the physicochemical properties of the substance as determined in Section 2 is negligible. 6.5. For those human effects and those environmental spheres for which it was not possible to determine a DNEL or a PNEC, a qualitative assessment of the likelihood that effects are avoided when implementing the exposure scenario shall be carried out. For substances satisfying the PBT and vPvB criteria, the manufacturer or importer shall use the information as obtained in Section 5, Step 2 when implementing on its site, and recommending for downstream users, risk management measures which minimise exposures and emissions to humans and the environment, throughout the lifecycle of the substance that results from manufacture or identified uses. 7.

      "text": "ANNEX II REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPILATION OF SAFETY DATA SHEETS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COMPILATION OF SAFETY DATA SHEETS PART A 0.1. Introduction 0.1.1. This Annex sets out the requirements that the supplier shall fulfil for the compilation of a safety data sheet that is provided for a substance or a mixture in accordance with Article 31. 0.1.2. The information on substances provided in the safety data sheet shall be consistent with the information in the registration and in the chemical safety report, where required. Where a chemical safety report has been completed, the relevant exposure scenario(s) shall be placed in an annex to the safety data sheet. 0.1.3. The safety data sheet shall mention in each relevant section whether and which different nanoforms it covers and link the relevant safety information to each of those nanoforms. As provided for in Annex VI, the term ‘nanoform’ in this Annex refers to a nanoform or a set of similar nanoforms. 0.2. General requirements for compiling a safety data sheet 0.2.1. The safety data sheet shall enable users to take the necessary measures relating to protection of human health and safety at the workplace, and protection of the environment. The writer of the safety data sheet shall take into account that a safety data sheet must inform its audience of the hazards of a substance or a mixture and provide information on the safe storage, handling and disposal of the substance or the mixture. 0.2.2. The information provided by safety data sheets shall also meet the requirements set out in Directive 98/24/EC. In particular, the safety data sheet shall enable employers to determine whether any hazardous chemical agents are present in the workplace and to assess any risk to the health and safety of workers arising from their use. 0.2.3. The information in the safety data sheet shall be written in a clear and concise manner. The safety data sheet shall be prepared by a competent person who shall take into account the specific needs and knowledge of the user audience, as far as they are known. Suppliers of substances and mixtures shall ensure that such competent persons have received appropriate training, including refresher training. 0.2.4. The language used in the safety data sheet shall be simple, clear and precise, avoiding jargon, acronyms and abbreviations. Statements such as ‘may be dangerous’, ‘no health effects’, ‘safe under most conditions of use’ or ‘harmless’ or any other statements indicating that the substance or mixture is not hazardous or any other statements that are inconsistent with the classification of that substance or mixture shall not be used. 0.2.5. The date of compilation of the safety data sheet shall be given on the first page. When a safety data sheet has been revised and the new, revised version is provided to recipients, the changes shall be brought to the attention of the recipients in Section 16 of the safety data sheet, unless the changes have been indicated elsewhere. For the revised safety data sheets, the date of compilation, identified as ‘Revision: (date)’, shall appear on the first page, as well as one or more indications of which version is replaced, such as version number, revision number, or supersedes date. 0.3. Safety data sheet format 0.3.1. A safety data sheet is not a fixed length document. The length of the safety data sheet shall be commensurate with the hazard of the substance or mixture and the information available. 0.3.2. All pages of a safety data sheet, including any annexes, shall be numbered and shall bear either an indication of the length of the safety data sheet (such as ‘page 1 of 3’) or an indication whether there is a page following (such as ‘Continued on next page’ or ‘End of safety data sheet’). 0.4. Safety data sheet content The information required by this Annex shall be included in the safety data sheet, where applicable and available, in the relevant subsections set out in Part B. The safety data sheet shall not contain blank subsections. 0.5. Other information requirements The inclusion of additional relevant and available information in the relevant subsections may be necessary in some cases in view of the wide range of properties of substances and mixtures. Additional safety and environmental information is required to address the needs of seafarers and other transport workers in the bulk transport of dangerous goods in sea-going or inland navigation bulk carriers or tank-vessels subject to International Maritime Organisation (IMO) or national regulations. Subsection 14.7 recommends the inclusion of basic classification information when such cargoes are transported in bulk according to the relevant IMO instruments. In addition, ships carrying oil or oil fuel, as defined in Annex I of MARPOL ( 33 ), in bulk or bunkering oil fuel are required, before loading, to be provided with a ‘material safety data sheet’ in accordance with the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) resolution ‘Recommendations for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for MARPOL Annex I Oil Cargo and Oil Fuel’ (MSC.286(86)). Therefore, in order to have one harmonised safety data sheet for maritime and non-maritime use, the additional provisions of Resolution MSC.286(86) may be included in the safety data sheets, where appropriate, for marine transport of MARPOL Annex I cargoes and marine fuel oils. 0.6. Units The units of measurement as set out in Council Directive 80/181/EEC ( 34 ) shall be used. 0.7. Special cases Safety data sheets shall also be required for the special cases listed in paragraph 1.3 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 for which there are labelling derogations. 1. SECTION 1: Identification of the substance/mixture and of the company/undertaking This section of the safety data sheet shall prescribe how the substance or mixture shall be identified and how the identified relevant uses, the name of the supplier of the substance or mixture and the contact detail information of the supplier of the substance or mixture, including an emergency contact, shall be provided in the safety data sheet. 1.1.

For substances subject to registration, the product identifier shall be consistent with that provided in the registration and the registration number assigned under Article 20(3) of this Regulation shall also be indicated. Additional identifiers may be provided even if they have not been used in the registration. Without affecting the obligations of downstream users laid down in Article 39 of this Regulation, the part of the registration number referring to the individual registrant of a joint submission may be omitted by a supplier who is a distributor or a downstream user provided that: (a) this supplier assumes the responsibility to provide the full registration number upon request for enforcement purposes or, if the full registration number is not available to him, to forward the request to his supplier, in line with point (b); and (b) this supplier provides the full registration number to the Member State authority responsible for enforcement (the enforcement authority) within 7 days upon request, received either directly from the enforcement authority or forwarded by his recipient, or, if the full registration number is not available to him, this supplier shall forward the request to his supplier within 7 days upon request and at the same time inform the enforcement authority thereof. A single safety data sheet may be provided to cover more than one substance or mixture where the information in that safety data sheet fulfils the requirements of this Annex for each of those substances or mixtures. Where different forms of a substance are covered by one safety data sheet, relevant information shall be included, clearly indicating which information is related to which form. Alternatively, a separate safety data sheet may be prepared per form or group of forms. If the safety data sheet pertains to one or more nanoforms, or substances that include nanoforms, this shall be indicated by using the word ‘nanoform’. Other means of identification Other names or synonyms by which the substance or mixture is labelled or commonly known may be provided. Where a mixture has a unique formula identifier (UFI) in accordance with section 5 of Part A of Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and that UFI is indicated in the safety data sheet, then the UFI shall be provided in this subsection. 1.2. Relevant identified uses of the substance or mixture and uses advised against At least a brief description of the identified uses (for example, floor cleaning, or industrial use in polymer production, or professional use in cleaning agents) relevant for the recipient(s) of the substance or mixture shall be indicated. The uses which the supplier advises against and the reasons why shall, where applicable, be stated. This need not be an exhaustive list. Where a chemical safety report is required, the information in this subsection of the safety data sheet shall be consistent with the identified uses in the chemical safety report and the exposure scenarios from the chemical safety report set out in the annex to the safety data sheet. 1.3. Details of the supplier of the safety data sheet The supplier of the safety data sheet, whether it is the manufacturer, importer, only representative, downstream user or distributor, shall be identified. The full address and telephone number of the supplier shall be given as well as an email address for a competent person responsible for the safety data sheet. In addition, if the supplier is not located in the Member State where the substance or mixture is placed on the market and he has nominated a responsible person for that Member State, a full address and telephone number for that responsible person shall be given. Where an only representative has been appointed, details of the non-Union manufacturer or formulator may also be provided. For registrants, the information on the supplier of the safety data sheet and, if provided, on the supplier of the substance or mixture, shall be consistent with the information on the identity of the manufacturer, importer or only representative provided in the registration. 1.4. Emergency telephone number References to emergency information services shall be provided. If an official advisory body exists in the Member State where the substance or mixture is placed on the market (this may be the body responsible for receiving information relating to health referred to in Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008), its telephone number shall be given and can suffice. If availability of such services is limited for any reasons, such as hours of operation, or if there are limits on specific types of information provided, this shall be clearly stated. 2. SECTION 2: Hazards identification This section of the safety data sheet shall describe the hazards of the substance or mixture and the appropriate warning information associated with those hazards. 2.1. Classification of the substance or mixture The classification of the substance or the mixture which results from the application of the classification criteria in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be given. Where the supplier has notified information regarding the substance to the classification and labelling inventory in accordance with Article 40 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, or has provided that information as part of a registration pursuant to this Regulation, the classification given in the safety data sheet shall be the same as the classification provided in that notification or registration. If the mixture does not meet the criteria for classification in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, this shall be clearly stated. Information on the substances in the mixture is provided under subsection 3.2. If the classification, including the hazard statements, is not written out in full, reference shall be made to section 16 where the full text of each classification, including each hazard statement, shall be given. The most important adverse physical, human health and environmental effects shall be listed in accordance with sections 9 to 12 of the safety data sheet, in such a way as to allow non-experts to identify the hazards of the substance or mixture. 2.2. Label elements Based on the classification, at least the following elements appearing on the label in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be provided: hazard pictogram(s), signal word(s), hazard statement(s) and precautionary statement(s). A graphical reproduction of the full hazard pictogram in black and white or a graphical reproduction of the symbol only may be substituted for the colour pictogram provided in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. The applicable label elements in accordance with Article 25(1) to (6) and Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 shall be provided. 2.3. Other hazards Information shall be provided on whether the substance meets the criteria for persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic or very persistent and very bioaccumulative in accordance with Annex XIII, whether the substance was included in the list established in accordance with Article 59(1) for having endocrine disrupting properties, and whether the substance is a substance identified as having endocrine disrupting properties in accordance with the criteria set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/2100 ( 35 ) or Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/605 ( 36 ). For a mixture, information shall be provided for each such substance that is present in the mixture at a concentration equal to or greater than 0,1 % by weight. Information shall be provided on other hazards which do not result in classification but which may contribute to the overall hazards of the substance or mixture, such as formation of air contaminants during hardening or processing, dustiness, explosive properties which do not fulfil the classification criteria of part 2 Section 2.1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, dust explosion hazards, cross-sensitisation, suffocation, freezing, high potency for odour or taste, or environmental effects like hazards to soil-dwelling organisms, or photochemical ozone creation potential. The statement ‘May form explosible dust-air mixture if dispersed’ is appropriate in the case of a dust explosion hazard. 3.

Persistence and degradability Degradability is the potential for the substance or the appropriate substances in a mixture to degrade in the environment, either through biodegradation or other processes, such as oxidation or hydrolysis. Persistence is the lack of demonstration of degradation in the situations defined in Sections 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 of Annex XIII. Test results relevant to assess persistence and degradability shall be given where available. If degradation half-lives are quoted it must be indicated whether these half-lives refer to mineralisation or to primary degradation. The potential of the substance or certain substances in a mixture to degrade in sewage treatment plants shall also be mentioned. Where experimental data are not available, the supplier shall consider whether reliable and relevant information obtained from models can be provided. This information shall be given where available and appropriate, for each individual substance in the mixture, which is required to be listed in section 3 of the safety data sheet. 12.3. Bioaccumulative potential Bioaccumulative potential is the potential of the substance or certain substances in a mixture to accumulate in biota and, eventually, to pass through the food chain. Test results relevant to assess the bioaccumulative potential shall be given. This shall include reference to the octanol-water partition coefficient (K ow ) and bioconcentration factor (BCF), or other relevant parameters related to bioaccumulation, if available. Where experimental data are not available, it shall be considered whether model predictions can be provided. This information shall be given where available and appropriate, for each individual substance in the mixture which is required to be listed in section 3 of the safety data sheet. 12.4. Mobility in soil Mobility in soil is the potential of the substance or the components of a mixture, if released to the environment, to move under natural forces to the groundwater or to a distance from the site of release. The potential for mobility in soil shall be given where available. Information on mobility in soil can be determined from relevant mobility data such as adsorption studies or leaching studies, known or predicted distribution to environmental compartments, or surface tension. For example, soil adsorption coefficient (Koc) values can be predicted from Kow. Leaching and mobility can be predicted from models. This information shall be given where available and appropriate, for each individual substance in the mixture which is required to be listed in section 3 of the safety data sheet. 12.5. Results of PBT and vPvB assessment Where a chemical safety report is required, the results of the PBT and vPvB assessment as set out in the chemical safety report shall be given. 12.6. Endocrine disrupting properties Information on adverse effects on the environment caused by endocrine disrupting properties shall be provided where available, for the substances identified as having endocrine disrupting properties in subsection 2.3. This information shall consist of brief summaries of the information derived from application of the assessment criteria laid down in the corresponding Regulations ((EC) No 1907/2006, (EU) 2017/2100, (EU) 2018/605), that is relevant to assess endocrine disrupting properties for the environment. 12.7.

      "text": "ANNEX VI INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 10 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 10 ▼M51 NOTE ON FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANNEXES VI TO XI Annexes VI to XI specify the information that shall be submitted for registration and evaluation purposes according to Articles 10, 12, 13, 40, 41 and 46. For the lowest tonnage level, the standard requirements are in Annex VII, and every time a new tonnage level is reached, the requirements of the corresponding Annex have to be added. For each registration the precise information requirements will differ, according to tonnage, use, and exposure. The Annexes shall thus be considered as a whole, and in conjunction with the overall requirements of registration, evaluation and the duty of care. A substance is defined in accordance with Article 3(1) and identified in accordance with section 2 in this Annex. A substance is always manufactured or imported in at least one form. A substance can also occur in more than one form. For all nanoforms covered by the registration certain specific information items shall be provided. Nanoforms shall be characterised as provided for in this Annex. The registrant shall justify why the information provided in the joint registration, covering the information requirements for the registered substances with nanoforms, is adequate for assessing the nanoforms. Information relevant to cover information requirements for such a substance can also be submitted separately by individual registrants, where justified in accordance with Article 11(3). More than one dataset may be required for one or more information requirements whenever there are significant differences in the properties relevant for the hazard, exposure and risk assessment and management of nanoforms. The information shall be reported in such a manner that it is clear which information in the joint submission pertains to which nanoform of the substance. Where technically and scientifically justified, the methodologies set out in Annex XI.1.5 shall be used within a registration dossier when two or more forms of a substance are ‘grouped’ for the purposes of one, more or possibly all the information requirements. The requirements specific to nanoforms apply without prejudice to requirements applicable to other forms of a substance. Definition of a nanoform and a set of similar nanoforms: On the basis of the Commission Recommendation of 18 October 2011 on the definition of nanomaterial ( 58 ), a nanoform is a form of a natural or manufactured substance containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50 % or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nm-100 nm, including also by derogation fullerenes, graphene flakes and single wall carbon nanotubes with one or more external dimensions below 1 nm. For this purpose, ‘particle’ means a minute piece of matter with defined physical boundaries; ‘agglomerate’ means a collection of weakly bound particles or aggregates where the resulting external surface area is similar to the sum of the surface areas of the individual components and ‘aggregate’ means a particle comprising of strongly bound or fused particles. A nanoform shall be characterised in accordance with section 2.4 below. A substance may have one or more different nanoforms, based on differences in the parameters in points 2.4.2 to 2.4.5. A ‘set of similar nanoforms’ is a group of nanoforms characterised in accordance with section 2.4 where the clearly defined boundaries in the parameters in the points 2.4.2 to 2.4.5 of the individual nanoforms within the set still allow to conclude that the hazard assessment, exposure assessment and risk assessment of these nanoforms can be performed jointly. A justification shall be provided to demonstrate that a variation within these boundaries does not affect the hazard assessment, exposure assessment and risk assessment of the similar nanoforms in the set. A nanoform can only belong to one set of similar nanoforms The term ‘nanoform’, when it is referred to in the other Annexes, shall refer to a nanoform or a set of similar nanoforms, when one has been defined, as defined in this Annex. STEP 1 — GATHER AND SHARE EXISTING INFORMATION The registrant should gather all existing available test data on the substance to be registered, this would include a literature search for relevant information on the substance. Wherever practicable, registrations should be submitted jointly, in accordance with Articles 11 or 19. This will enable test data to be shared, thereby avoiding unnecessary testing and reducing costs. The registrant should also collect all other available and relevant information on the substance including on all nanoforms of the substance that are covered by the registration, regardless whether testing for a given endpoint is required or not at the specific tonnage level. This should include information from alternative sources (e.g. from (Q)SARs, read-across from other substances, in vivo and in vitro testing, epidemiological data) which may assist in identifying the presence or absence of hazardous properties of the substance and which can in certain cases replace the results of animal tests. In addition, information on exposure, use and risk management measures in accordance with article 10 and this Annex should be collected. Considering all this information together, the registrant will be able to determine the need to generate further information. ▼C1 STEP 2 — CONSIDER INFORMATION NEEDS The registrant shall identify what information is required for the registration. First, the relevant Annex or Annexes to be followed shall be identified, according to tonnage. These Annexes set out the standard information requirements, but shall be considered in conjunction with Annex XI, which allows variation from the standard approach, where it can be justified. In particular, information on exposure, use and risk management measures shall be considered at this stage in order to determine the information needs for the substance. ▼M51 STEP 3 — IDENTIFY INFORMATION GAPS The registrant shall then compare the information needs for the substance with the information already available and the extent to which currently available information can be applied to all nanoforms covered by the registration and identify where there are gaps. It is important at this stage to ensure that the available data is relevant and has sufficient quality to fulfil the requirements. STEP 4 — GENERATE NEW DATA/PROPOSE TESTING STRATEGY In some cases it will not be necessary to generate new data. However, where there is an information gap that needs to be filled, new data shall be generated (Annexes VII and VIII), or a testing strategy shall be proposed (Annexes IX and X), depending on the tonnage. New tests on vertebrates shall only be conducted or proposed as a last resort when all other data sources have been exhausted. The above approach shall also apply if there is a gap of available information for one or more nanoforms of the substance included in the jointly submitted registration dossier. In some cases, the rules set out in Annexes VII to XI may require certain tests to be undertaken earlier than or in addition to the standard requirements. NOTES Note 1: If it is not technically possible, or if it does not appear scientifically necessary to give information, the reasons shall be clearly stated, in accordance with the relevant provisions. Note 2: The registrant may wish to declare that certain information submitted in the registration dossier is commercially sensitive and its disclosure might harm him commercially. If this is the case, he shall list the items and provide a justification. ▼C1 INFORMATION REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 10(a) (i) TO (v) 1. GENERAL REGISTRANT INFORMATION 1.1. Registrant ▼M70 1.1.1.

      "text": "ANNEX VII STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSTANCES MANUFACTURED OR IMPORTED IN QUANTITIES OF ONE TONNE OR MORE (59) STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSTANCES MANUFACTURED OR IMPORTED IN QUANTITIES OF ONE TONNE OR MORE ( 59 ) Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for: (a) non-phase-in substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 to 10 tonnes; (b) phase-in substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 to 10 tonnes and meeting the criteria in Annex III in accordance with Article 12(1)(a) and (b); and (c) substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 10 tonnes or more. Any other relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information that is available shall be provided. For substances not meeting the criteria in Annex III only the physicochemical requirements as set out in section 7 of this Annex are required. Column 2 of this Annex lists specific rules according to which the required standard information may be omitted, replaced by other information, provided at a different stage or adapted in another way. If the conditions are met under which column 2 of this Annex allows adaptations, the registrant shall clearly state this fact and the reasons for each adaptation under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier. ▼M51 Without prejudice to the information submitted for other forms, any relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information shall include characterisation of the nanoform tested and test conditions. A justification shall be provided where QSARs are used or evidence is obtained by means other than testing, as well as a description of the range of the characteristics/properties of the nanoforms to which the evidence can be applied. ▼C1 In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may adapt the required standard information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general rules contained in Annex XI with the exception of Section 3 on substance-tailored exposure waiving. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the reasons for any decision to adapt the standard information under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier referring to the appropriate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in Annex XI ( 60 ). Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid (Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concentration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. ▼M64 Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels. If dose (concentration) selection is limited by the physicochemical properties or biological effects of the test substance, justification shall be provided. ▼C1 When, for certain endpoints, information is not provided for other reasons than those mentioned in column 2 of this Annex or in Annex XI, this fact and the reasons shall also be clearly stated. 7. INFORMATION ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SUBSTANCE COLUMN 1 STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIRED COLUMN 2 SPECIFIC RULES FOR ADAPTATION FROM COLUMN 1 7.1. State of the substance at 20 °C and 101,3 kPa 7.2. Melting/freezing point 7.2. The study does not need to be conducted below a lower limit of - 20 °C. 7.3. Boiling point 7.3. The study does not need to be conducted: — for gases, or — for solids which either melt above 300 °C or decompose before boiling. In such cases the boiling point under reduced pressure may be estimated or measured, or — for substances which decompose before boiling (e.g. auto-oxidation, rearrangement, degradation, decomposition, etc.). 7.4. Relative density 7.4. The study does not need to be conducted if: — the substance is only stable in solution in a particular solvent and the solution density is similar to that of the solvent. In such cases, an indication of whether the solution density is higher or lower than the solvent density is sufficient, or — the substance is a gas. In this case, an estimation based on calculation shall be made from its molecular weight and the Ideal Gas Laws. 7.5. Vapour pressure 7.5. The study does not need to be conducted if the melting point is above 300 °C. If the melting point is between 200 °C and 300 °C, a limit value based on measurement or a recognised calculation method is sufficient. ►M64 7.6. Surface tension of an aqueous solution ◄ 7.6. The study need only be conducted if: — based on structure, surface activity is expected or can be predicted, or — surface activity is a desired property of the material. If the water solubility is below 1 mg/l at 20 °C the test does not need to be conducted. ▼M51 7.7. Water solubility For nanoforms, in addition the testing of dissolution rate in water as well as in relevant biological and environmental media shall be considered. 7.7. The study does not need to be conducted if: — the substance is hydrolytically unstable at pH 4, 7 and 9 (half-life less than 12 hours), or — the substance is readily oxidisable in water. If the substance appears ‘insoluble’ in water, a limit test up to the detection limit of the analytical method shall be performed. For nanoforms the potential confounding effect of dispersion shall be assessed when conducting the study. For metals and sparingly soluble metal compounds, information on transformation/dissolution in aqueous media shall be provided. 7.8. Partition coefficient n-octanol/water 7.8. The study does not need to be conducted if the substance is inorganic. If the test cannot be performed (e.g. the substance decomposes, has a high surface activity, reacts violently during the performance of the test or does not dissolve in water or in octanol, or it is not possible to obtain a sufficiently pure substance), a calculated value for log P as well as details of the calculation method shall be provided. For nanoforms the potential confounding effect of dispersion in octanol and water shall be assessed when conducting the study. For nanoforms, whether of inorganic or organic substances, for which the partition coefficient n-octanol/water is not applicable the study of dispersion stability shall be considered instead. ▼C1 7.9. Flash-point 7.9. The study does not need to be conducted if: — the substance is inorganic, or — the substance only contains volatile organic components with flash-points above 100 °C for aqueous solutions, or — the estimated flash-point is above 200 °C, or — the flash-point can be accurately predicted by interpolation from existing characterised materials. 7.10. Flammability 7.10. The study does not need to be conducted: — if the substance is a solid which possesses explosive or pyrophoric properties. These properties should always be considered before considering flammability, or — for gases, if the concentration of the flammable gas in a mixture with inert gases is so low that, when mixed with air, the concentration is all time below the lower limit, or — for substances which spontaneously ignite when in contact with air. 7.11. Explosive properties 7.11. The study does not need to be conducted if: — there are no chemical groups associated with explosive properties present in the molecule, or — the substance contains chemical groups associated with explosive properties which include oxygen and the calculated oxygen balance is less than -200, or — the organic substance or a homogenous mixture of organic substances contains chemical groups associated with explosive properties, but the exothermic decomposition energy is less than 500 J/g and the onset of exothermic decomposition is below 500 °C, or — for mixtures of inorganic oxidising substances (UN Division 5.1) with organic materials, the concentration of the inorganic oxidising substance is: — — less than 15 %, by mass, if assigned to UN Packaging Group I (high hazard) or II (medium hazard), — less than 30 %, by mass, if assigned to UN Packaging Group III (low hazard). Note : Neither a test for propagation of detonation nor a test for sensitivity to detonative shock is required if the exothermic decomposition energy of organic materials is less than 800 J/g. 7.12. Self-ignition temperature 7.12. The study does not need to be conducted: — if the substance is explosive or ignites spontaneously with air at room temperature, or — for liquids non flammable in air, e.g. no flash point up to 200 °C, or — for gases having no flammable range, or — for solids, if the substance has a melting point ≤ 160 °C, or if preliminary results exclude self-heating of the substance up to 400 °C. 7.13. Oxidising properties 7.13. The study does not need to be conducted if: — the substance is explosive, or — the substance is highly flammable, or — the substance is an organic peroxide, or — the substance is incapable of reacting exothermically with combustible materials, for example on the basis of the chemical structure (e.g. organic substances not containing oxygen or halogen atoms and these elements are not chemically bonded to nitrogen or oxygen, or inorganic substances not containing oxygen or halogen atoms). The full test does not need to be conducted for solids if the preliminary test clearly indicates that the test substance has oxidising properties. Note that as there is no test method to determine the oxidising properties of gaseous mixtures, the evaluation of these properties must be realised by an estimation method based on the comparison of the oxidising potential of gases in a mixture with that of the oxidising potential of oxygen in air. 7.14. Granulometry 7.14. The study does not need to be conducted if the substance is marketed or used in a non solid or granular form. ▼M51 7.14 bis. Dustiness For nanoforms 7.14 bis. The study does not need to be conducted if exposure to granular form of the substance during its life-cycle can be excluded. ▼C1 8. TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION COLUMN 1 STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIRED COLUMN 2 SPECIFIC RULES FOR ADAPTATION FROM COLUMN 1 ▼M36 8.1. Skin corrosion/irritation 8.1.

If information from test method(s) addressing one or two of the key events in column 1 already allows classification and risk assessment according to point 8.3, studies addressing the other key event(s) need not be conducted. 8.3.2. Skin sensitisation, in vivo An in vivo study shall be conducted only if in vitro/in chemico test methods described under point 8.3.1 are not applicable, or the results obtained from those studies are not adequate for classification and risk assessment according to point 8.3.

A justification shall be provided where QSARs are used or evidence is obtained by means other than testing, as well as a description of the range of the characteristics/properties of the nanoforms to which the evidence can be applied. ▼C1 In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may adapt the required standard information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general rules contained in Annex XI. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the reasons for any decision to adapt the standard information under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier referring to the appropriate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in Annex XI ( 62 ). Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid (Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concentration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. ▼M64 Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels. If dose (concentration) selection is limited by the physicochemical properties or biological effects of the test substance, justification shall be provided. ▼C1 When, for certain endpoints, information is not provided for other reasons than those mentioned in column 2 of this Annex or in Annex XI, this fact and the reasons shall also be clearly stated. ▼M51 7.

An in vivo study for serious eye damage/eye irritation shall be conducted only if the in vitro study/studies) under point 8.2.1 of Annex VII is/are not applicable, or the results of this/these study/studies) are not adequate for classification and risk assessment. The study does not need to be conducted if: — the substance is classified as skin corrosion, or — the substance is a strong acid (pH ≤ 2,0) or base (pH ≥ 11,5), or — the substance is spontaneously flammable in air or in contact with water or moisture at room temperature. ▼C1 8.4. Mutagenicity ►M70 8.4. The studies referred to in points 8.4.2 and 8.4.3 do not need to be conducted in any of the following cases: — adequate data from the corresponding in vivo study, (namely in vivo chromosomal aberration (or micronucleus) study regarding point 8.4.2 or in vivo mammalian gene mutation study regarding point 8.4.3), are available, — the substance is known to cause germ cell mutagenicity, meeting the criteria for classification as germ cell mutagen category 1A or 1B, and appropriate risk management measures are implemented, — the substance is known to be a genotoxic carcinogen, meeting the criteria for classification both in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity category 1A, 1B or 2 and in the hazard class carcinogenicity category 1A or 1B, and appropriate risk management measures are implemented. — In case of a positive result in any of the in vitro genotoxicity studies referred to in Annex VII or this Annex, which gives rise to concern, the registrant shall propose, or the Agency may require, an appropriate in vivo study referred to in Annex IX, point 8.4. The in vivo study shall address the chromosomal aberration concern or the gene mutation concern or both as appropriate. — In case an in vitro mutagenicity study referred to in points 8.4.2 or 8.4.3 is not applicable for the substance, the registrant shall provide a justification and shall propose or the Agency may require an appropriate in vivo study referred to in Annex IX, point 8.4.4.

Appropriate in vivo mutagenicity studies shall be considered in case of a positive result in any of the genotoxicity studies in Annex VII or VIII. ▼M51 8.5. Acute toxicity 8.5. The study/ies do(es) not generally need to be conducted if: — the substance is classified as corrosive to the skin. In addition to the oral route (8.5.1.) or to the inhalation route (8.5.2) for nanoforms, for substances other than gases, the information mentioned under 8.5.1. to 8.5.3. shall be provided for at least one other route. The choice for the second route will depend on the nature of the substance and the likely route of human exposure. If there is only one route of exposure, information for only that route needs to be provided. ▼M36 8.5.2. By inhalation 8.5.2. Testing by the inhalation route is appropriate if exposure of humans via inhalation is likely taking into account the vapour pressure of the substance and/or the possibility of exposure to aerosols, particles or droplets of an inhalable size. 8.5.3. By dermal route 8.5.3. Testing by the dermal route is appropriate if: (1) inhalation of the substance is unlikely; and (2) skin contact in production and/or use is likely; and (3) the physicochemical and toxicological properties suggest potential for a significant rate of absorption through the skin. Testing by the dermal route does not need to be conducted if: — the substance does not meet the criteria for classification as acute toxicity or STOT SE by the oral route and — no systemic effects have been observed in in vivo studies with dermal exposure (e.g. skin irritation, skin sensitisation) or, in the absence of an in vivo study by the oral route, no systemic effects after dermal exposure are predicted on the basis of non-testing approaches (e.g. read across, QSAR studies). ▼C1 8.6. Repeated dose toxicity ▼M51 8.6.1. Short-term repeated dose toxicity study (28 days), one species, male and female, most appropriate route of administration, having regard to the likely route of human exposure. 8.6.1. The short-term toxicity study (28 days) does not need to be conducted if: ►M64 — da reliable sub-chronic (90 days) or chronic toxicity study is available or proposed by the registrant, provided that an appropriate species, dosage, solvent and route of administration are used, or ◄ — where a substance undergoes immediate disintegration and there are sufficient data on the cleavage products, or — relevant human exposure can be excluded in accordance with Annex XI Section 3. The appropriate route shall be chosen on the following basis: Testing by the dermal route is appropriate if: — inhalation of the substance is unlikely, and — skin contact in production and/or use is likely, and — the physicochemical and toxicological properties suggest potential for a significant rate of absorption through the skin. Testing by the inhalation route is appropriate if exposure of humans via inhalation is likely taking into account the vapour pressure of the substance and/or the possibility of exposure to aerosols, particles or droplets of an inhalable size. For nanoforms without high dissolution rate in biological media, the study shall include toxicokinetic investigations on, among others, the recovery period and, where relevant, lung clearance. Toxicokinetic investigations do not need to be performed if equivalent toxicokinetic information on the nanoform is already available. The sub-chronic toxicity study (90 days) (Annex IX, point 8.6.2) shall be proposed by the registrant, or may be required by the Agency if: the frequency and duration of human exposure indicates that a longer term study is appropriate; and one of the following conditions is met: — other available data indicate that the substance may have a dangerous property that cannot be detected in a short-term toxicity study, or — appropriately designed toxicokinetic studies reveal accumulation of the substance or its metabolites in certain tissues or organs which would possibly remain undetected in a short-term toxicity study but which are liable to result in adverse effects after prolonged exposure. ►M70 Further studies shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency in case of: ◄ — failure to identify a NOAEL in the 28 or the 90 days study, unless the reason for the failure to identify a NOAEL is absence of adverse toxic effects, or — toxicity of particular concern (e.g. serious/severe effects), or — indications of an effect for which the available evidence is inadequate for toxicological and/or risk characterisation. In such cases it may also be more appropriate to perform specific toxicological studies that are designed to investigate these effects (e.g. immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and in particular for nanoforms indirect genotoxicity), or — the route of exposure used in the initial repeated dose study was inappropriate in relation to the expected route of human exposure and route-to-route extrapolation cannot be made, or — particular concern regarding exposure (e.g. use in consumer products leading to exposure levels which are close to the dose levels at which toxicity to humans may be expected), or — effects shown in substances with a clear relationship in molecular structure with the substance being studied, were not detected in the 28 or the 90 days study. ▼C1 8.7. Reproductive toxicity ▼M70 8.7.1. Screening for reproductive/developmental toxicity (OECD TG 421 or TG 422); the preferred species is the rat. The route of administration shall be oral if the substance is a solid or liquid, and inhalation if the substance is a gas; deviations may be made if scientifically justified, for example through evidence of equivalent or higher systemic exposure via another relevant route of human exposure or route-specific toxicity. 8.7.1. This study does not need to be conducted in any of the following cases: — the substance is known to be a genotoxic carcinogen, meeting the criteria for classification both in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity category 1A, 1B or 2 and in the hazard class carcinogenicity category 1A or 1B, and appropriate risk management measures are implemented, — the substance is known to be a germ cell mutagen, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity category 1A or 1B and appropriate risk management measures are implemented, — relevant human exposure can be excluded in accordance with Annex XI, Section 3, — a pre-natal developmental toxicity study (OECD TG 414) referred to in Annex IX, point 8.7.2 or an Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (OECD TG 443) referred to in Annex IX, point 8.7.3 is available or proposed by the registrant; or a Two-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (OECD TG 416) is available, — a substance is known to have an adverse effect on sexual function or fertility, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class reproductive toxicity category 1A or 1B: May damage fertility (H360F), and the available data are adequate to support a robust risk assessment, — a substance is known to cause developmental toxicity, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class reproductive toxicity category 1A or 1B: May damage the unborn child (H360D), and the available data are adequate to support a robust risk assessment. — In case of serious concerns about potential adverse effects on sexual function, fertility or development, the registrant shall propose, or the Agency may require either an Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (OECD TG 443), referred to in Annex IX, point 8.7.3, or a pre-natal developmental toxicity study (OECD TG 414), referred to in Annex IX, point 8.7.2, instead of the screening study (OECD TG 421 or 422) to address those concerns. Those serious concerns include among others: — adverse effects related to sexual function, fertility or development based on available information, not meeting the criteria for classification as reproductive toxicity category 1A or 1B, — possible developmental or reproductive toxicity of the substance predicted from information on structurally related substances, (Q)SAR estimates or in vitro methods. ▼M51 8.8. Toxicokinetics 8.8.1. Assessment of the toxicokinetic behaviour of the substance to the extent that can be derived from the relevant available information. ►M70 For nanoforms without high dissolution rate in biological media a toxicokinetics study shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency in case such an assessment cannot be performed on the basis of relevant available information, including from the study conducted in accordance with 8.6.1 ◄ The choice of the study will depend on the remaining information gaps and the results of the chemical safety assessment. ▼C1 9. ECOTOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION COLUMN 1 STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIRED COLUMN 2 SPECIFIC RULES FOR ADAPTATION FROM COLUMN 1 ▼M70 9.1. Aquatic toxicity 9.1. Long-term aquatic toxicity testing referred to in Annex IX, subsection 9.1, in addition to short-term toxicity testing shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency if the chemical safety assessment performed in accordance with Annex I indicates that it is needed to further investigate the effects on aquatic organisms, for example when further information is needed for the refinement of the PNEC or if additional toxicity information as set out in Annex XIII, point 3.2.3, would be necessary to assess PBT or vPvB properties of the substance. The choice of the appropriate test(s) shall be made on the basis of the results of the chemical safety assessment. ▼M70 9.1.3. Short-term toxicity testing on fish 9.1.3. The study does not need to be conducted in any of the following cases: — there are factors indicating that short-term aquatic toxicity is unlikely to occur, for instance if the substance is highly insoluble in water or the substance is unlikely to cross biological membranes, — a long-term aquatic toxicity study on fish is available. — For nanoforms, the study may not be waived on the basis of high insolubility in water alone. — The registrant may propose long-term toxicity testing instead of short-term toxicity testing. — Long-term toxicity testing on fish referred to in Annex IX, point 9.1.6, shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency when it is unlikely that short-term toxicity testing can provide a true measure of the intrinsic aquatic toxicity of the substance, for instance: — if the substance is poorly water soluble (below 1 mg/L), or — for nanoforms with low dissolution rate in the relevant test media. ▼M51 9.1.4. Activated sludge respiration inhibition testing 9.1.4. The study does not need to be conducted if: — there is no emission to a sewage treatment plant, or — there are mitigating factors indicating that microbial toxicity is unlikely to occur, for instance the substance is highly insoluble in water, or — the substance is found to be readily biodegradable and the applied test concentrations are in the range of concentrations that can be expected in the influent of a sewage treatment plant. For nanoforms, the study may not be waived on the basis of high insolubility in water alone. The study may be replaced by a nitrification inhibition test if available data show that the substance is likely to be an inhibitor of microbial growth or function, in particular nitrifying bacteria. 9.2. Degradation ►M70 9.2. Further information on degradation shall be generated or further degradation testing as described in Annex IX shall be proposed if the chemical safety assessment performed in accordance with Annex I indicates that it is needed to further investigate the degradation of the substance. That could for example be the case if additional information on degradation as set out in Annex XIII, point 3.2.1, is required to assess PBT or vPvB properties of the substance in accordance with subsection 2.1 of that Annex. For nanoforms that are not soluble, nor have high dissolution rate, such test(s) shall consider morphological transformation (e.g. irreversible changes in particle size, shape and surface properties, loss of coating), chemical transformation (e.g. oxidation, reduction) and other abiotic degradation (e.g. photolysis). The choice of the appropriate test(s) shall be made on the basis of the results of the chemical safety assessment. In case the generation of additional information requires further testing in accordance with Annex IX, the registrant shall propose or the Agency may require such testing. ◄ 9.2.2. Abiotic 9.2.2.1. Hydrolysis as a function of pH. ►M70 9.2.2.1. The study does not need to be conducted in any of the following cases: — the substance is readily biodegradable, — the substance is highly insoluble in water, — based on the structure, the substance does not have chemical groups that can hydrolyse. For nanoforms, the study may not be waived on the basis of high insolubility in water alone. ◄ ▼C1 9.3. Fate and behaviour in the environment ►M70 9.3. Further information on bioaccumulation shall be generated if additional information on bioaccumulation as set out in Annex XIII, point 3.2.2, is required to assess PBT or vPvB properties of the substance in accordance with subsection 2.1 of that Annex. In case the generation of additional information requires further testing in accordance with Annex IX or Annex X, the registrant shall propose or the Agency may require such testing. ◄ ▼M51 9.3.1. Adsorption/desorption screening 9.3.1. The study does not need to be conducted if: — based on the physicochemical properties the substance can be expected to have a low potential for adsorption (e.g. the substance has a low octanol-water partition coefficient), or — the substance and its relevant degradation products decompose rapidly. The study may not be waived on the basis of low octanol-water partition coefficient alone, unless the adsorptive properties of the substance are solely driven by lipophilicity. For instance, the study may not be waived on the basis of low octanol-water partition coefficient alone if the substance is surface active or ionisable at environmental pH (pH 4 – 9). For nanoforms, use of any physicochemical property (e.g. octanol-water partition coefficient) as a reason for waiving the study shall include adequate justification of its relevance to low potential for adsorption. ▼C1",

Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for all substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 100 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 12(1)(d). Accordingly, the information required in column 1 of this Annex is additional to that required in column 1 of Annexes VII and VIII. Any other relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information that is available shall be provided. Column 2 of this Annex lists specific rules according to which the registrant may propose to omit the required standard information, replace it by other information, provide it at a later stage or adapt it in another way. If the conditions are met under which column 2 of this Annex allows an adaptation to be proposed, the registrant shall clearly state this fact and the reasons for proposing each adaptation under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier. ▼M51 Without prejudice to the information submitted for other forms, any relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information shall include characterisation of the nanoform tested and test conditions.

In this case as well, he shall clearly state the reasons for any decision to propose adaptations to the standard information under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier referring to the appropriate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in Annex XI ( 64 ). Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid (Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concentration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. ▼M64 Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels.

The in vivo mammalian somatic cell genotoxicity study does not need to be conducted if there are adequate results available from an appropriate in vivo mammalian somatic cell genotoxicity study. 8.4.5. An appropriate in vivo mammalian germ cell genotoxicity study, if there is a positive result in an available in vivo mammalian somatic cell genotoxicity study, which gives rise to concern. The in vivo mammalian germ cell genotoxicity study shall address the chromosomal aberration concern or the gene mutation concern or both, as appropriate. 8.4.5. The study does not need to be conducted if there is clear evidence that neither the substance nor its metabolites reach the germ cells. ▼C1 8.6. Repeated dose toxicity ▼M64 ————— ▼M51 8.6.2. Sub-chronic toxicity study (90-day), one species, rodent, male and female, most appropriate route of administration, having regard to the likely route of human exposure. 8.6.2. The sub-chronic toxicity study (90 days) does not need to be conducted if: — a reliable short-term toxicity study (28 days) is available showing severe toxicity effects meeting the criteria for classifying the substance as STOT RE (category 1 or 2), for which the observed NOAEL-28 days, with the application of an appropriate uncertainty factor, allows the extrapolation towards the NOAEL-90 days for the same route of exposure, or — a reliable chronic toxicity study is available or proposed by the registrant, provided that an appropriate species and route of administration are used, or; ◄ — a substance undergoes immediate disintegration and there are sufficient data on the cleavage products (both for systemic effects and effects at the site of uptake), or — the substance is unreactive, insoluble and not inhalable and there is no evidence of absorption and no evidence of toxicity in a 28-day ‘limit test’, particularly if such a pattern is coupled with limited human exposure. The appropriate route shall be chosen on the following basis: Testing by the dermal route is appropriate if: (1) skin contact in production and/or use is likely; and (2) the physicochemical properties suggest a significant rate of absorption through the skin; and (3) one of the following conditions is met: — toxicity is observed in the acute dermal toxicity test at lower doses than in the oral toxicity test, or — systemic effects or other evidence of absorption is observed in skin and/or eye irritation studies, or — in vitro tests indicate significant dermal absorption, or — significant dermal toxicity or dermal penetration is recognised for structurally-related substances. Testing by the inhalation route is appropriate if: — exposure of humans via inhalation is likely taking into account the vapour pressure of the substance and/or the possibility of exposure to aerosols, particles or droplets of an inhalable size. For nanoforms without high dissolution rate in biological media, the study shall include toxicokinetic investigations on, among others, the recovery period and, where relevant, lung clearance. Toxicokinetic investigations do not need to be performed if equivalent toxicokinetic information on the nanoform is already available. Further studies shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency in accordance with Articles 40 or 41 in case of: — failure to identify a NOAEL in the 90 days study unless the reason for the failure to identify a NOAEL is absence of adverse toxic effects, or — toxicity of particular concern (e.g. serious/severe effects), or — indications of an effect for which the available evidence is inadequate for toxicological and/or risk characterisation. In such cases it may also be more appropriate to perform specific toxicological studies that are designed to investigate these effects (e.g. immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and in particular for nanoforms indirect genotoxicity), or — particular concern regarding exposure (e.g. use in consumer products leading to exposure levels which are close to the dose levels at which toxicity to humans may be expected). ▼C1 8.7. Reproductive toxicity ►M64 8.7. The studies do not need to be conducted if: — the substance is known to be a genotoxic carcinogen, meeting the criteria for classification both in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity (category 1A or 1B or 2) and carcinogenicity (category 1A or 1B), and appropriate risk management measures are implemented, or — the substance is known to be a germ cell mutagen, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity (category 1A or 1B) and appropriate risk management measures are implemented, or — the substance is of low toxicological activity (a comprehensive and informative dataset showing no toxicity in any of the tests available), it can be proven from toxicokinetic data that no systemic absorption occurs via relevant routes of exposure (e.g. plasma/blood concentrations below detection limit using a sensitive method and absence of the substance and of metabolites of the substance in urine, bile or exhaled air) and there is no or no significant human exposure. If a substance is known to have an adverse effect on sexual function and fertility, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class reproductive toxicity (category 1A or 1B: May damage fertility (H360F)), and the available data are adequate to support a robust risk assessment, then no further testing for sexual function and fertility shall be necessary. If a substance is known to cause developmental toxicity, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class reproductive toxicity (category 1A or 1B: May damage the unborn child (H360D)), and the available data are adequate to support a robust risk assessment, then no further testing for developmental toxicity shall be necessary. ◄ ▼M70 8.7.2. Pre-natal developmental toxicity study (OECD TG 414) on one species; the preferred species is the rat or the rabbit. The route of administration shall be oral if the substance is a solid or liquid, and inhalation if the substance is a gas; deviations may be made if scientifically justified, for example through evidence of equivalent or higher systemic exposure via another relevant route of human exposure or route-specific toxicity. 8.7.2. An additional pre-natal developmental toxicity study in a second species, that is the other preferred species to the one used in the first study, shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency if there is a concern for developmental toxicity based on the outcome of the first study and all other relevant data. That could be the case for example if the study on the first species shows developmental toxicity not meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class reproductive toxicity category 1A or 1B; May damage the unborn child (H360D). Deviations from the default route of administration and deviations in the choice of species shall be scientifically justified. ▼M29 ►M70 8.7.3. Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (OECD TG 443), basic test design (cohorts 1A and 1B without extension to include an F2 generation), one species, if the available repeated dose toxicity studies (e.g. 28-day or 90-day studies, or OECD TG 421 or 422 screening studies) indicate adverse effects on reproductive organs or tissues or reveal other concerns in relation with reproductive toxicity. The route of administration shall be oral if the substance is a solid or liquid, and inhalation if the substance is a gas; deviations may be made if scientifically justified, for example through evidence of equivalent or higher systemic exposure via another relevant route of human exposure or route-specific toxicity. ◄ 8.7.3. An Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study with the extension of cohort 1B to include the F2 generation shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency if: (a) the substance has uses leading to significant exposure of consumers or professionals, taking into account, inter alia, consumer exposure from articles, and (b) any of the following conditions are met: — the substance displays genotoxic effects in somatic cell mutagenicity tests in vivo which could lead to classifying it as Mutagen Category 2, or — there are indications that the internal dose for the substance and/or any of its metabolites will reach a steady state in the test animals only after an extended exposure, or — there are indications of one or more relevant modes of action related to endocrine disruption from available in vivo studies or non-animal approaches. ►M70 An Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study including cohorts 2A/2B (developmental neurotoxicity) and/or cohort 3 (developmental immunotoxicity) shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency in case of particular concerns on (developmental) neurotoxicity or (developmental) immunotoxicity justified by any of the following: ◄ — existing information on the substance itself derived from relevant available in vivo or non-animal approaches (e.g. abnormalities of the CNS, evidence of adverse effects on the nervous or immune system in studies on adult animals or animals exposed prenatally), or — specific mechanisms/modes of action of the substance with an association to (developmental) neurotoxicity and/or (developmental) immunotoxicity (e.g. cholinesterase inhibition or relevant changes in thyroidal hormone levels associated to adverse effects), or — existing information on effects caused by substances structurally analogous to the substance being studied, suggesting such effects or mechanisms/modes of action. Other studies on developmental neurotoxicity and/or developmental immunotoxicity instead of cohorts 2A/2B (developmental neurotoxicity) and/or cohort 3 (developmental immunotoxicity) of the Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study may be proposed by the registrant in order to clarify the concern on developmental toxicity. Two-generation reproductive toxicity studies (B.35, OECD TG 416) that were initiated before 13 March 2015 shall be considered appropriate to address this standard information requirement. The study shall be performed on one species. The need to perform a study at this tonnage level or the next on a second strain or a second species may be considered and a decision should be based on the outcome of the first test and all other relevant available data. ▼C1 9. ECOTOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION COLUMN 1 STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIRED COLUMN 2 SPECIFIC RULES FOR ADAPTATION FROM COLUMN 1 9.1. Aquatic toxicity ►M70 9.1. Long-term toxicity testing other than the tests referred to in points 9.1.5 and 9.1.6 shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency if the chemical safety assessment performed in accordance with Annex I indicates that it is needed to further investigate the effects of the substance on aquatic organisms. The choice of the test(s) shall be made on the basis of the results of the chemical safety assessment. ◄ 9.1.5. Long-term toxicity testing on invertebrates (preferred species Daphnia ), (unless already provided as part of Annex VII requirements) ▼M70 9.1.6. Long-term toxicity testing on fish, (unless already provided as part of Annex VIII requirements). The information shall be provided for subpoint 9.1.6.1 or subpoint 9.1.6.3. 9.1.6. Fish short-term toxicity tests on embryo and sac-fry stages (OECD TG 212) that were initiated before 14 April 2022 shall be considered appropriate to address this standard information requirement provided that the substance is not highly lipophilic (log Kow > 4) or there is no indication of endocrine disrupting properties or any other specific mode of action. 9.1.6.1. Fish early-life stage (FELS) toxicity test (OECD TG 210) ▼M70 ————— ▼M70 9.1.6.3. Fish juvenile growth test (OECD TG 215) ▼C1 9.2. Degradation ►M70 9.2. Further degradation testing shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency if the chemical safety assessment performed in accordance with Annex I indicates that it is needed to further investigate the degradation of the substance and its transformation or degradation products. The choice of the appropriate test(s) and test media shall be made on the basis of the results of the chemical safety assessment. ◄ 9.2.1. Biotic ▼M51 9.2.1.2. Simulation testing on ultimate degradation in surface water 9.2.1.2. The study need not be conducted if: the substances is highly insoluble in water, or the substance is readily biodegradable. For nanoforms, the study may not be waived on the basis of high insolubility in water alone. ▼C1 9.2.1.3. Soil simulation testing (for substances with a high potential for adsorption to soil) 9.2.1.3. The study need not be conducted: — if the substance is readily biodegradable, or — if direct and indirect exposure of soil is unlikely. 9.2.1.4. Sediment simulation testing (for substances with a high potential for adsorption to sediment) 9.2.1.4. The study need not be conducted: — if the substance is readily biodegradable, or — if direct and indirect exposure of sediment is unlikely. ►M70 9.2.3. Identification of transformation and abiotic and biotic degradation products ◄ 9.2.3. Unless the substance is readily biodegradable ▼M51 9.3. Fate and behaviour in the environment 9.3.2. Bioaccumulation in aquatic species, preferably fish 9.3.2. The study need not be conducted if: the substance has a low potential for bioaccumulation (for instance a log Kow ≤ 3) and/or a low potential to cross biological membranes, or direct and indirect exposure of the aquatic compartment is unlikely. The study may not be waived on the basis of low octanol-water partition coefficient alone, unless the potential for bioaccumulation of the substance is solely driven by lipophilicity. For instance, the study may not be waived on the basis of low octanol-water partition coefficient alone if the substance is surface active or ionisable at environmental pH (pH 4 – 9). For nanoforms, use of any physicochemical property (e.g. octanol water partition coefficient, dissolution rate, dispersion stability) as a reason for waiving the study shall include adequate justification of its relevance to low potential for bioaccumulation or unlikely direct and indirect exposure of the aquatic compartment. 9.3.3. Further information on adsorption/desorption depending on the results of the study required in Annex VIII 9.3.3. The study need not be conducted if: based on the physicochemical properties, the substance can be expected to have a low potential for adsorption (e.g. the substance has a low octanol water partition coefficient), or the substance and its degradation products decompose rapidly. The study may not be waived on the basis of low octanol-water partition coefficient alone, unless the adsorptive properties of the substance are solely driven by lipophilicity. For instance, the study may not be waived on the basis of low octanol-water partition coefficient alone if the substance is surface active or ionisable at environmental pH (pH 4 – 9). For nanoforms, use of any physicochemical property (e.g. octanol water partition coefficient, dissolution rate, dispersion stability) as a reason for waiving the study shall include adequate justification of its relevance to low potential for adsorption. 9.4. Effects on terrestrial organisms ►M70 9.4. These studies do not need to be conducted if direct and indirect exposure of the soil compartment is unlikely. In the absence of toxicity data for soil organisms, the equilibrium partitioning method may be applied to assess the hazard to soil organisms. Where the equilibrium partitioning method is applied to nanoforms, this shall be scientifically justified. The choice of the appropriate test(s) shall be made on the basis of the results of the chemical safety assessment. In particular for substances that have a high potential to adsorb to soil or that are very persistent, the registrant shall propose or the Agency may require long-term toxicity testing as referred to in Annex X instead of short-term toxicity testing. ◄ ▼C1 9.4.1.

Column 1 of this Annex establishes the standard information required for all substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 1 000 tonnes or more in accordance with Article 12(1)(e). Accordingly, the information required in column 1 of this Annex is additional to that required in column 1 of Annexes VII, VIII and IX. Any other relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information that is available shall be provided. Column 2 of this Annex lists specific rules according to which the registrant may propose to omit the required standard information, replace it by other information, provide it at a later stage or adapt it in another way. If the conditions are met under which column 2 of this Annex allows an adaptation to be proposed, the registrant shall clearly state this fact and the reasons for proposing each adaptation under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier. ▼M51 Without prejudice to the information submitted for other forms, any relevant physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological information shall include characterisation of the nanoform tested and test conditions. A justification shall be provided where QSARs are used or evidence is obtained by means other than testing, as well as a description of the range of the characteristics/properties of the nanoforms to which the evidence can be applied. ▼C1 In addition to these specific rules, a registrant may propose to adapt the required standard information set out in column 1 of this Annex according to the general rules contained in Annex XI. In this case as well, he shall clearly state the reasons for any decision to propose adaptations to the standard information under the appropriate headings in the registration dossier referring to the appropriate specific rule(s) in column 2 or in Annex XI ( 66 ). Before new tests are carried out to determine the properties listed in this Annex, all available in vitro data, in vivo data, historical human data, data from valid (Q)SARs and data from structurally related substances (read-across approach) shall be assessed first. In vivo testing with corrosive substances at concentration/dose levels causing corrosivity shall be avoided. Prior to testing, further guidance on testing strategies should be consulted in addition to this Annex. ▼M64 Where a test method offers flexibility in the study design, for example in relation to the choice of dose levels, the chosen study design shall ensure that the data generated are adequate for hazard identification and risk assessment. To this end, testing shall be performed at appropriately high dose levels. If dose (concentration) selection is limited by the physicochemical properties or biological effects of the test substance, justification shall be provided. ▼C1 When, for certain endpoints, it is proposed not to provide information for other reasons than those mentioned in column 2 of this Annex or in Annex XI, this fact and the reasons shall also be clearly stated. 8. TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION COLUMN 1 STANDARD INFORMATION REQUIRED COLUMN 2 SPECIFIC RULES FOR ADAPTATION FROM COLUMN 1 ▼M70 8.4. Mutagenicity 8.4. The studies referred to in points 8.4.6 and 8.4.7 do not need to be conducted in any of the following cases: — the substance is known to cause germ cell mutagenicity, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity category 1A or 1B, and appropriate risk management measures are implemented, — the substance is known to be a genotoxic carcinogen, meeting the criteria for classification both in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity category 1A or 1B or 2 and in the hazard class carcinogenicity category 1A or 1B, and appropriate risk management measures are implemented. ▼M70 8.4.6. A second in vivo mammalian somatic cell genotoxicity study, if there is a positive result in any of the in vitro genotoxicity studies referred to in Annex VII or Annex VIII, which gives rise to both chromosomal aberration concern and gene mutation concern. The second study shall address chromosomal aberration or gene mutation, as appropriate, which has not been addressed by the first in vivo mammalian somatic cell genotoxicity study. 8.4.7. A second in vivo mammalian germ cell genotoxicity study, if there is a positive result in in vivo mammalian somatic cell genotoxicity studies, which gives rise to both chromosomal aberration concern and gene mutation concern. The second study shall address the chromosomal aberration or gene mutation, as appropriate, which has not been addressed by the first in vivo mammalian germ cell genotoxicity study. 8.4.7. The study does not need to be conducted if there is clear evidence that neither the substance nor its metabolites reach the germ cells. ▼M51 8.6.3. A long-term repeated toxicity study (≥ 12 months) may be proposed by the registrant or required by the Agency in accordance with Articles 40 or 41 if the frequency and duration of human exposure indicates that a longer term study is appropriate and one of the following conditions is met: — serious or severe toxicity effects of particular concern were observed in the 28-day or 90-day study for which the available evidence is inadequate for toxicological evaluation or risk characterisation, or — effects shown in substances with a clear relationship in molecular structure with the substance being studied were not detected in the 28-day or 90-day study, or — the substance may have a dangerous property that cannot be detected in a 90-day study. If nanoforms are covered by the registration, physicochemical characteristics, in particular particle size, shape and other morphological parameters, surface functionalisation and surface area, as well as molecular structure shall be taken into consideration when determining if one of the conditions above are met. ▼C1 8.6.4. Further studies shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency in accordance with Articles 40 or 41 in case of: — toxicity of particular concern (e.g. serious/severe effects), or — indications of an effect for which the available evidence is inadequate for toxicological evaluation and/or risk characterisation. In such cases it may also be more appropriate to perform specific toxicological studies that are designed to investigate these effects (e.g. immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity), or — particular concern regarding exposure (e.g. use in consumer products leading to exposure levels which are close to the dose levels at which toxicity is observed). 8.7. Reproductive toxicity ►M64 8.7. The studies do not need to be conducted if: — the substance is known to be a genotoxic carcinogen, meeting the criteria for classification both in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity (category 1A or 1B or 2) and carcinogenicity (category 1A or 1B), and appropriate risk management measures are implemented, or — the substance is known to be a germ cell mutagen, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class germ cell mutagenicity (category 1A or 1B) and appropriate risk management measures are implemented, or — the substance is of low toxicological activity (a comprehensive and informative dataset showing no toxicity seen in any of the tests available), it can be proven from toxicokinetic data that no systemic absorption occurs via relevant routes of exposure (e.g. plasma/blood concentrations below detection limit using a sensitive method and absence of the substance and of metabolites of the substance in urine, bile or exhaled air) and there is no or no significant human exposure. If a substance is known to have an adverse effect on sexual function and fertility, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class reproductive toxicity (category 1A or 1B: May damage fertility (H360F)), and the available data are adequate to support a robust risk assessment, then no further testing for sexual function and fertility shall be necessary. If a substance is known to cause developmental toxicity, meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class reproductive toxicity (category 1A or 1B: May damage the unborn child (H360D)), and the available data are adequate to support a robust risk assessment, then no further testing for developmental toxicity shall be necessary. ◄ ▼M70 8.7.2. Pre-natal developmental toxicity study (OECD TG 414) in a second species, the preferred species is the rat or the rabbit, whichever was not used in the first study under Annex IX. The route of administration shall be oral if the substance is a solid or liquid, and inhalation if the substance is a gas; deviations may be made if scientifically justified, for example through evidence of equivalent or higher systemic exposure via another relevant route of human exposure or route-specific toxicity. Deviations from the default route of administration and deviations in the choice of species shall be scientifically justified. ▼M29 ►M70 8.7.3. Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (OECD TG 443), basic test design (cohorts 1A and 1B without extension to include an F2 generation), one species, unless already provided as part of Annex IX requirements.

Other studies on developmental neurotoxicity and/or developmental immunotoxicity instead of cohorts 2A/2B (developmental neurotoxicity) and/or cohort 3 (developmental immunotoxicity) of the Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study may be proposed by the registrant in order to clarify the concern on developmental toxicity. Two-generation reproductive toxicity studies (B.35, OECD TG 416) that were initiated before 13 March 2015 shall be considered appropriate to address this standard information requirement. ▼C1 8.9.1. Carcinogenicity study 8.9.1. A carcinogenicity study may be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency in accordance with Articles 40 or 41 if: — the substance has a widespread dispersive use or there is evidence of frequent or long-term human exposure, and ►M3 — the substance is classified as germ cell mutagen category 2 or there is evidence from the repeated dose study(ies) that the substance is able to induce hyperplasia and/or pre-neoplastic lesions. ◄ If the substance is classified as germ cell mutagen category 1A or 1B, the default presumption would be that a genotoxic mechanism for carcinogenicity is likely.

Degradation ►M70 9.2. Further degradation testing shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency, if the chemical safety assessment performed in accordance with Annex I indicates that it is needed to further investigate the degradation of the substance and its transformation and degradation products.

The choice of the appropriate test(s) depends on the results of the chemical safety assessment. 9.4. Effects on terrestrial organisms ►M70 9.4. Long-term toxicity testing shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency if the results of the chemical safety assessment performed in accordance with Annex I indicates that it is needed to further investigate the effects of the substance or of transformation and degradation products on terrestrial organisms. The choice of the appropriate test(s) shall be made on the basis of the outcome of the chemical safety assessment. These studies do not need to be conducted if direct and indirect exposure of the soil compartment is unlikely. ◄ 9.4.4.

Long-term toxicity testing on plants, unless already provided as part of Annex IX requirements. 9.5.1. Long-term toxicity to sediment organisms ►M70 9.5.1. Long-term toxicity testing shall be proposed by the registrant or may be required by the Agency if the results of the chemical safety assessment performed in accordance with Annex I indicates that it is needed to further investigate the effects of the substance or of relevant transformation and degradation products on sediment organisms. The choice of the appropriate test(s) shall be made on the basis of the results of the chemical safety assessment. ◄ 9.6.1. Long-term or reproductive toxicity to birds 9.6.1.

In addition to the specific rules set out in column 2 of Annexes VII to X, a registrant may adapt the standard testing regime in accordance with the general rules set out in Section 1 of this Annex. Under dossier evaluation the Agency may assess these adaptations to the standard testing regime. ▼M51 The requirements specific to nanoforms in this Annex are without prejudice to requirements applicable to other forms of a substance. ▼C1 1. TESTING DOES NOT APPEAR SCIENTIFICALLY NECESSARY 1.1. Use of existing data ▼M64 Any data generated as from 1 June 2008 shall not be considered as existing data and shall not be subject to the general rules for adaptation laid down in this point (1.1). ▼M64 1.1.1. Data on physical-chemical properties from experiments not carried out according to the test methods referred to in Article 13(3) ▼C1 Data shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the corresponding test methods referred to in Article 13(3) if the following conditions are met: (1) adequacy for the purpose of classification and labelling and/or risk assessment; (2) sufficient documentation is provided to assess the adequacy of the study; and (3) the data are valid for the endpoint being investigated and the study is performed using an acceptable level of quality assurance. 1.1.2. Data on human health and environmental properties from experiments not carried out according to GLP or the test methods referred to in Article 13(3) Data shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the corresponding test methods referred to in Article 13(3) if the following conditions are met: (1) adequacy for the purpose of classification and labelling and/or risk assessment; (2) adequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters foreseen to be investigated in the corresponding test methods referred to in Article 13(3); (3) exposure duration comparable to or longer than the corresponding test methods referred to in Article 13(3) if exposure duration is a relevant parameter; and (4) adequate and reliable documentation of the study is provided. ▼M51 1.1.3. Historical human data Historical human data, such as epidemiological studies on exposed populations, accidental or occupational exposure data and clinical studies, shall be considered. The strength of the data for a specific human health effect depends, among other things, on the type of analysis and on the parameters covered and on the magnitude and specificity of the response and consequently the predictability of the effect. Criteria for assessing the adequacy of the data include: (1) the proper selection and characterisation of the exposed and control groups; (2) adequate characterisation of exposure; (3) sufficient length of follow-up for disease occurrence; (4) valid method for observing an effect; (5) proper consideration of bias and confounding factors; and (6) a reasonable statistical reliability to justify the conclusion. In all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided. When nanoforms are covered by the registration the above approach shall address the nanoforms separately. ▼M51 1.2. Weight of evidence ▼M64 There is sufficient weight of evidence when information from several independent sources together enable, through a reasoned justification, a conclusion on the information requirement, while the information from each single source alone is insufficient to fulfil the information requirement. The justification must have regard to the information that would otherwise be obtained from the study that shall normally be performed for this information requirement. There may also be sufficient weight of evidence from the use of newly developed test methods, not yet included in the test methods referred to in Article 13(3), leading to a reasoned justification that they provide the information that would enable a conclusion on the information requirement. Weight of evidence may lead to the conclusion that a substance has or has not a particular property. If there is sufficient weight of evidence, the information requirement is fulfilled. Consequently, further testing on vertebrate animals shall be omitted and further testing not involving vertebrate animals may be omitted. In all cases, the information provided shall be adequate for the purpose of classification, labelling and/or risk assessment, and adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided, including: — robust study summaries of the studies used as sources of information; — a justification explaining why the sources of information together provide a conclusion on the information requirement. When nanoforms are covered by the registration, the above approach shall address the nanoforms separately. ▼M51 1.3. Qualitative or Quantitative structure-activity relationship ((Q)SAR) Results obtained from valid qualitative or quantitative structure-activity relationship models ((Q)SARs) may indicate the presence or absence of a certain dangerous property. Results of (Q)SARs may be used instead of testing when the following conditions are met: — results are derived from a (Q)SAR model whose scientific validity has been established, — the substance falls within the applicability domain of the (Q)SAR model, — results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and/or risk assessment, and — adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is provided. The Agency in collaboration with the Commission, Member States and interested parties shall develop and provide guidance in assessing which (Q)SARs will meet these conditions and provide examples. When nanoforms are covered by the registration the above approach shall address the nanoforms separately. ▼C1 1.4. In vitro methods Results obtained from suitable in vitro methods may indicate the presence of a certain dangerous property or may be important in relation to a mechanistic understanding, which may be important for the assessment. In this context, ‘suitable’ means sufficiently well developed according to internationally agreed test development criteria (e.g. the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM)) criteria for the entry of a test into the prevalidation process). Depending on the potential risk, immediate confirmation requiring testing beyond the information foreseen in Annexes VII or VIII or proposed confirmation requiring testing beyond the information foreseen in Annexes IX or X for the respective tonnage level may be necessary. If the results obtained from the use of such in vitro methods do not indicate a certain dangerous property, the relevant test shall nevertheless be carried out at the appropriate tonnage level to confirm the negative result, unless testing is not required in accordance with Annexes VII to X or the other rules in this Annex. ▼M51 Such confirmation may be waived if the following conditions are met: (1) results are derived from an in vitro method whose scientific validity has been established by a validation study, according to internationally agreed validation principles; (2) results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and/or risk assessment; and (3) adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is provided. When nanoforms are covered by the registration the above approach in points (1) to (3) shall address the nanoforms separately. ▼C1 1.5. Grouping of substances and read-across approach ▼M64 Substances whose physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties are likely to be similar or follow a regular pattern as a result of structural similarity, may be considered as a group, or category, of substances. Application of the group concept requires that physicochemical properties, human health effects and environmental effects or environmental fate may be predicted from data for reference substance(s) within the group by interpolation to other substances in the group (read-across approach). This avoids the need to test every substance for every endpoint. When nanoforms are covered by the registration, the above approach shall address the nanoforms separately. For grouping different nanoforms of the same substance, the molecular structural similarities alone may not serve as a justification. If nanoforms covered by a registration are grouped or placed in a ‘category’ with other forms, including other nanoforms, of the substance in the same registration the obligations above shall apply in the same manner. The similarities may be based on any of the following: (1) a common functional group; (2) the common precursors and/or the likelihood of common breakdown products via physical and biological processes, which result in structurally similar chemicals; (3) a constant pattern in the changing of the potency of the properties across the category. Structural similarity for UVCB substances shall be established on the basis of similarities in the structures of the constituents, together with the concentration of these constituents and variability in the concentration of these constituents. If it can be demonstrated that the identification of all individual constituents is not technically possible or impractical, the structural similarity may be demonstrated by other means, to enable a quantitative and qualitative comparison of the actual composition between substances. If the group concept is applied, substances shall be classified and labelled on this basis. In all cases, results shall fulfil all of the following conditions: — be adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and/or risk assessment, — have adequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters addressed in the corresponding study that shall normally be performed for a particular information requirement, — cover an exposure duration comparable to or longer than the corresponding study that shall normally be performed for a particular information requirement if exposure duration is a relevant parameter. In all cases, adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method shall be provided. Such documentation shall include: — a robust study summary for each source study used in the adaptation; — an explanation why the properties of the registered substance may be predicted from other substances in the group; — supporting information to scientifically justify such explanation for prediction of properties. ▼C1 2. TESTING IS TECHNICALLY NOT POSSIBLE Testing for a specific endpoint may be omitted, if it is technically not possible to conduct the study as a consequence of the properties of the substance: e.g. very volatile, highly reactive or unstable substances cannot be used, mixing of the substance with water may cause danger of fire or explosion or the radio-labelling of the substance required in certain studies may not be possible. The guidance given in the test methods referred to in Article 13(3), more specifically on the technical limitations of a specific method, shall always be respected. ▼M4 3. SUBSTANCE-TAILORED EXPOSURE-DRIVEN TESTING ▼M64 3.1. Testing in accordance with Section 8.7 of Annex VIII and in accordance with Annex IX and Annex X may be omitted, based on the exposure scenario(s) developed in the Chemical Safety Report. Testing in accordance with Section 8.6.1 of Annex VIII may be omitted only for registrants producing less than 100 tonnes per year per manufacturer or importer, based on the exposure scenario(s) developed in the Chemical Safety Report. ▼M4 3.2. In all cases, adequate justification and documentation shall be provided. The justification shall be based on a thorough and rigorous exposure assessment in accordance with section 5 of Annex I and shall meet any one of the following criteria: (a) the manufacturer or importer demonstrates and documents that all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) the results of the exposure assessment covering all relevant exposures throughout the life cycle of the substance demonstrate the absence of or no significant exposure in all scenarios of the manufacture and all identified uses as referred to in Annex VI section 3.5; ▼M64 (ii) a DNEL or a PNEC can be derived from results of available test data for the substance concerned taking full account of the increased uncertainty resulting from the omission of the information requirement, and that DNEL or PNEC is relevant and appropriate both to the information requirement to be omitted and for risk assessment purposes. For this purpose and without prejudice to column 2 of Sections 8.6 and 8.7 of Annexes IX and X, a DNEL derived from a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study shall not be considered appropriate to omit a 90-day repeated dose toxicity study, and a DNEL derived from a screening test for reproductive/developmental toxicity shall not be considered appropriate to omit a prenatal developmental toxicity study or an extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study. ▼M4 (iii) the comparison of the derived DNEL or PNEC with the results of the exposure assessment shows that exposures are always well below the derived DNEL or PNEC; (b) where the substance is not incorporated in an article the manufacturer or importer demonstrates and documents for all relevant scenarios that throughout the life cycle strictly controlled conditions as set out in Article 18(4)(a) to (f) apply; (c) where the substance is incorporated in an article in which it is permanently embedded in a matrix or otherwise rigorously contained by technical means, it is demonstrated and documented that all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) the substance is not released during its life cycle; (ii) the likelihood that workers or the general public or the environment are exposed to the substance under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use is negligible; and (iii) the substance is handled according to the conditions set out in Article 18(4)(a) to (f) during all manufacturing and production stages including the waste management of the substance during these stages. 3.3. The specific conditions of use must be communicated through the supply chain in accordance with Article 31 or 32, as the case may be. ▼C1",

      "text": "ANNEX XII GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM USERS TO ASSESS SUBSTANCES AND PREPARE CHEMICAL SAFETY REPORTS GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM USERS TO ASSESS SUBSTANCES AND PREPARE CHEMICAL SAFETY REPORTS ▼M51 INTRODUCTION The purpose of this Annex is to set out how downstream users are to assess and document that the risks arising from the substance(s) they use are adequately controlled during their use for a use not covered by the Safety Data Sheet supplied to them and that other users further down the supply chain can adequately control the risks. The assessment shall cover the life-cycle of the substance, from its receipt by the downstream user, for his own uses and for his identified uses further down the supply chain. The assessment shall consider the use of the substance on its own, in a mixture or in an article. The assessment shall address all nanoforms that are covered by the registration. Justifications and conclusions drawn from the assessment shall be relevant to the nanoforms, from their receipt by the downstream user, for his own uses and for his identified uses further down the supply chain. In carrying out the chemical safety assessment and producing the Chemical Safety Report, the downstream user shall take account of information received from the supplier of the chemical in accordance with Article 31 and 32 of this Regulation. When nanoforms of the substance are covered by his own use or his identified uses down the supply chain, an appropriate metric for the assessment and presentation of the results in steps 1- 6 of the chemical safety assessment under 0.6.1 and 0.6.2 shall be considered, with the justification included in the chemical safety report and summarised in the safety data sheet. A multiple metric presentation is preferable, ensuring availability of mass metric information. Where available and appropriate, an assessment carried out under Community legislation, (e.g. risk assessments completed under Regulation (EEC) No 793/93) shall be taken into account in the chemical safety assessment and be reflected in the Chemical Safety Report. Deviations from such assessments shall be justified. Assessments carried out under other international and national programmes may also be taken into account. The process which the downstream user goes through in carrying out the chemical safety assessment and in producing his Chemical Safety Report, involves three steps: ▼C1 STEP 1: DEVELOPMENT OF EXPOSURE SCENARIO(S) The downstream user shall develop exposure scenarios for uses not covered in a Safety Data Sheet supplied to him in accordance with Section 5 of Annex I. STEP 2: IF NECESSARY, A REFINEMENT OF THE HAZARD ASSESSMENT BY THE SUPPLIER If the downstream user considers the hazard and PBT assessments reported in the Safety Data Sheet supplied to him to be appropriate, then no further hazard assessment or PBT and vPvB assessment is necessary. In this case he shall use the relevant information reported by the supplier for the risk characterisation. This shall be stated in the Chemical Safety Report. ▼M51 When nanoforms of the substance are covered by his own use or his identified uses down the supply chain, the assessment shall cover the hazard, PBT and vPvB assessment of nanoforms(s) as used. ▼C1 If the downstream user considers the assessments reported in the Safety Data Sheet supplied to him to be inappropriate, then he shall carry out the relevant assessments in accordance with Sections 1 to 4 of Annex I as appropriate to him. ▼M51 In those cases where the downstream user considers that information, in addition to that provided by the supplier, is necessary for producing his Chemical Safety Report, the downstream user shall gather this information. Where this information can only be obtained by testing on vertebrate animals, he shall submit a proposal for a testing strategy to the Agency in accordance with Article 38. He shall explain why he considers that additional information is necessary. While waiting for results of further testing, he shall record in his chemical safety report the risk management measures intended to manage the risks being explored that he has put in place. The above record taking shall address all nanoforms that are covered by his own uses or his identified uses down the supply chain. Such information shall be relevant to the nanoforms. ▼C1 On completion of any additional testing, the downstream user shall revise the Chemical Safety Report, and his Safety Data Sheet if he is required to prepare one, as appropriate. STEP 3: RISK CHARACTERISATION A risk characterisation shall be carried out for each new exposure scenario as prescribed in Section 6 of Annex I. The risk characterisation shall be presented under the relevant heading of the Chemical Safety Report and summarised in the Safety Data Sheet under the relevant heading(s). When generating an exposure scenario it will be necessary to make initial assumptions about the operating conditions and risk managements measures. If the initial assumptions lead to a risk characterisation indicating inadequate protection of human health and the environment, then it shall be necessary to carry out an iterative process with amendment of one or a number of factors until adequate control can be demonstrated. This may require the generation of additional hazard or exposure information or appropriate alteration of the process, operating conditions or risk management measures. Therefore, iterations may be made between on the one hand developing and revising an (initial) exposure scenario, which includes developing and implementing risk management measures, and on the other hand generating further information to produce the definitive exposure scenario. The purpose of generating further information is to establish a more precise risk characterisation, based on a refined hazard assessment and/or exposure assessment. The downstream user shall produce a Chemical Safety Report detailing his chemical safety assessment using Part B, Sections 9 and 10, of the format set out in Section 7 of Annex I and the other sections of this format, if appropriate.",

      "text": "ANNEX XIII CRITERIA FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND VERY PERSISTENT AND VERY BIOACCUMULATIVE SUBSTANCES CRITERIA FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND VERY PERSISTENT AND VERY BIOACCUMULATIVE SUBSTANCES This Annex lays down the criteria for the identification of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBT substances), and very persistent and very bioaccumulative substances (vPvB substances) as well as the information that must be considered for the purpose of assessing the P, B, and T properties of a substance. For the identification of PBT substances and vPvB substances a weight-of-evidence determination using expert judgement shall be applied, by comparing all relevant and available information listed in Section 3.2 with the criteria set out in Section 1. This shall be applied in particular where the criteria set out in Section 1 cannot be applied directly to the available information. A weight-of-evidence determination means that all available information bearing on the identification of a PBT or a vPvB substance is considered together, such as the results of monitoring and modelling, suitable in vitro tests, relevant animal data, information from the application of the category approach (grouping, read-across), (Q)SAR results, human experience such as occupational data and data from accident databases, epidemiological and clinical studies and well documented case reports and observations. The quality and consistency of the data shall be given appropriate weight. The available results regardless of their individual conclusions shall be assembled together in a single weight-of-evidence determination. The information used for the purposes of assessment of the PBT/vPvB properties shall be based on data obtained under relevant conditions. The identification shall also take account of the PBT/vPvB-properties of relevant constituents of a substance and relevant transformation and/or degradation products. This Annex shall apply to all organic substances, including organo-metals. 1. CRITERIA FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF PBT AND vPvB SUBSTANCES 1.1. PBT Substances A substance that fulfils the persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity criteria of Sections 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 shall be considered to be a PBT substance. 1.1.1. Persistence A substance fulfils the persistence criterion (P) in any of the following situations: (a) the degradation half-life in marine water is higher than 60 days; (b) the degradation half-life in fresh or estuarine water is higher than 40 days; (c) the degradation half-life in marine sediment is higher than 180 days; (d) the degradation half-life in fresh or estuarine water sediment is higher than 120 days; (e) the degradation half-life in soil is higher than 120 days. 1.1.2. Bioaccumulation A substance fulfils the bioaccumulation criterion (B) when the bioconcentration factor in aquatic species is higher than 2 000 . 1.1.3. Toxicity A substance fulfils the toxicity criterion (T) in any of the following situations: (a) the long-term no-observed effect concentration (NOEC) or EC10 for marine or freshwater organisms is less than 0,01 mg/l; (b) the substance meets the criteria for classification as carcinogenic (category 1A or 1B), germ cell mutagenic (category 1A or 1B), or toxic for reproduction (category 1A, 1B, or 2) according to Regulation EC No 1272/2008; (c) there is other evidence of chronic toxicity, as identified by the substance meeting the criteria for classification: specific target organ toxicity after repeated exposure (STOT RE category 1 or 2) according to Regulation EC No 1272/2008. 1.2. vPvB Substances A substance that fulfils the persistence and bioacumulation criteria of Sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 shall be considered to be a vPvB substance. 1.2.1. Persistence A substance fulfils the ‘very persistent’ criterion (vP) in any of the following situations: (a) the degradation half-life in marine, fresh or estuarine water is higher than 60 days; (b) the degradation half-life in marine, fresh or estuarine water sediment is higher than 180 days; (c) the degradation half-life in soil is higher than 180 days. 1.2.2. Bioaccumulation A substance fulfils the ‘very bioaccumulative’ criterion (vB) when the bioconcentration factor in aquatic species is higher than 5 000 . 2. SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT OF P, vP, B, vB and T PROPERTIES 2.1. Registration For the identification of PBT and vPvB substances in the registration dossier, the registrant shall consider the information as described in Annex I and in Section 3 of this Annex. If the technical dossier contains for one or more endpoints only information as required in Annexes VII and VIII, the registrant shall consider information relevant for screening for P, B, or T properties in accordance with Section 3.1 of this Annex. If the result from the screening tests or other information indicate that the substance may have PBT or vPvB properties, the registrant shall generate relevant additional information as set out in Section 3.2 of this Annex. In case the generation of relevant additional information would require information listed in Annexes IX or X, the registrant shall submit a testing proposal. Where the process and use conditions of the substance meet the conditions as specified in Section 3.2(b) or (c) of Annex XI the additional information may be omitted, and subsequently the substance is considered as if it is a PBT or vPvB in the registration dossier. No additional information needs to be generated for the assessment of PBT/vPvB properties if there is no indication of P or B properties following the result from the screening test or other information. 2.2. Authorisation For dossiers for the purposes of identifying substances referred to in Article 57(d) and Article 57(e), relevant information from the registration dossiers and other available information as described in Section 3 shall be considered. 3.

INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL PROVISIONS This Annex lays down general principles for preparing dossiers to propose and justify: ▼M3 ————— ▼M3 — the identification of CMRs, PBTs, vPvBs, or a substance of equivalent concern in accordance with Article 59, ▼C1 — restrictions of the manufacture, placing on the market or use of a substance within the Community. The relevant parts of Annex I shall be used for the methodology and format of any dossier according to this Annex. For all dossiers any relevant information from registration dossiers shall be considered and other available information may be used. For hazard information which has not been previously submitted to the Agency, a robust study summary shall be included in the dossier. II. CONTENT OF DOSSIERS ▼M3 ————— ▼C1 2. Dossier for the identification of a substance as a CMR, PBT, vPvB or a substance of equivalent concern according to Article 59 Proposal The proposal shall include the identity of substance(s) concerned and whether it is proposed to be identified as a CMR according to Article 57(a), (b) or (c), a PBT according to Article 57(d), a vPvB according to Article 57(e), or a substance of equivalent concern according to Article 57(f). Justification A comparison of the available information with the criteria in Annex XIII for PBT according to Article 57(d), and vPvBs according to Article 57(e), or an assessment of the hazards and a comparison with Article 57(f), according to the relevant parts of Sections 1 to 4 of Annex I shall be completed. This shall be documented in the format set out in Part B of the Chemical Safety Report in Annex I. Information on exposures, alternative substances and risks The available use and exposure information and information on alternative substances and techniques shall be provided. 3. Dossiers for restrictions proposal Proposal The proposal shall include the identity of the substance and the restriction(s) proposed for the manufacture, placing on the market or use(s) and a summary of the justification. Information on hazard and risk The risks to be addressed with the restriction shall be described based on an assessment of the hazard and risks according to the relevant parts of Annex I and shall be documented in the format set out in Part B of that Annex for the Chemical Safety Report. Evidence shall be provided that implemented risk management measures (including those identified in registrations under Articles 10 to 14) are not sufficient. Information on alternatives Available information on alternative substances and techniques shall be provided, including: — information on the risks to human health and the environment related to the manufacture or use of the alternatives, — availability, including the time scale, — technical and economical feasibility. Justification for Restrictions at Community Level Justification shall be provided that: — action is required on a Community-wide basis, — a restriction is the most appropriate Community wide measure which shall be assessed using the following criteria: (i) effectiveness: the restriction must be targeted to the effects or exposures that cause the risks identified, capable of reducing these risks to an acceptable level within a reasonable period of time and proportional to the risk; (ii) practicality: the restriction must be implementable, enforceable and manageable; (iii) monitorability: it must be possible to monitor the result of the implementation of the proposed restriction. Socio-economic assessment The socio-economic impacts of the proposed restriction may be analysed with reference to Annex XVI. To this end, the net benefits to human health and the environment of the proposed restriction may be compared to its net costs to manufacturers, importers, downstream users, distributors, consumers and society as a whole. Information on stakeholder consultation Information on any consultation of stakeholders and how their views have been taken into account shall be included in the dossier.",

      "text": "ANNEX XVI SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS This Annex outlines the information that may be addressed by those submitting a socio-economic analysis (SEA) with an application for authorisation, as specified in Article 62(5)(a), or in connection with a proposed restriction, as specified in Article 69(6)(b). The Agency shall prepare guidance for the preparation of SEAs. SEAs, or contributions to them, shall be submitted in the format specified by the Agency in accordance with Article 111. However, the level of detail and scope of the SEA, or contributions to them, shall be the responsibility of the applicant for authorisation, or, in the case of a proposed restriction, the interested party. The information provided can address the socio-economic impacts at any level. An SEA may include the following elements: — impact of a granted or refused authorisation on the applicant(s), or, in the case of a proposed restriction, the impact on industry (e.g. manufacturers and importers). The impact on all other actors in the supply chain, downstream users and associated businesses in terms of commercial consequences such as impact on investment, research and development, innovation, one-off and operating costs (e.g. compliance, transitional arrangements, changes to existing processes, reporting and monitoring systems, installation of new technology, etc.) taking into account general trends in the market and technology, — impacts of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction, on consumers. For example, product prices, changes in composition or quality or performance of products, availability of products, consumer choice, as well as effects on human health and the environment to the extent that these affect consumers, — social implications of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction. For example job security and employment, — availability, suitability, and technical feasibility of alternative substances and/or technologies, and economic consequences thereof, and information on the rates of, and potential for, technological change in the sector(s) concerned. In the case of an application for authorisation, the social and/or economic impacts of using any available alternatives, — wider implications on trade, competition and economic development (in particular for SMEs and in relation to third countries) of a granted or refused authorisation, or a proposed restriction. This may include consideration of local, regional, national or international aspects, — in the case of a proposed restriction, proposals for other regulatory or non-regulatory measures that could meet the aim of the proposed restriction (this shall take account of existing legislation). This should include an assessment of the effectiveness and the costs linked to alternative risk management measures, — in the case of a proposed restriction or refused authorisation, the benefits for human health and the environment as well as the social and economic benefits of the proposed restriction. For example, worker health, environmental performance and the distribution of these benefits, for example, geographically, population groups, — an SEA may also address any other issue that is considered to be relevant by the applicant(s) or interested party.",
