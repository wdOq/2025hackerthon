    "reasoning": "The abstract compares inorganic binders (sodium silicate and geopolymer) to organic resins and reports over 90% reductions in BTEX compounds, including ethylbenzene, and significant decreases in other harmful emissions. It explicitly states these inorganic binders as viable, sustainable solutions for minimizing occupational and ecological risks, indicating a safety advantage over conventional organic systems that emit ethylbenzene.",

    "target": "ethylbenzene",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares emissions from ethylbenzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons, noting that ethylbenzene produced the highest unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions, while Indane exhibited the lowest levels of these pollutants, suggesting more complete combustion. This implies that Indane may be a safer alternative to ethylbenzene in terms of emission-related safety.",

    "reasoning": "The abstract discusses biodiesel as a suitable alternative fuel that reduces emissions of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) compared to diesel. This indicates a safety advantage in terms of lower emissions of ethylbenzene when using biodiesel. Therefore, biodiesel is presented as a safer alternative to ethylbenzene-containing diesel fuel.",

    "target": "ethylbenzene",
    "reasoning": "The abstract discusses using alternative glycols, specifically monoethylene glycol (MEG), as a strategy to reduce BTEX emissions, including ethylbenzene, during natural gas dehydration. It states that MEG is the best scenario for reducing BTEX emissions with efficient dew point control, implying a safety advantage by lowering harmful emissions compared to conventional methods involving ethylbenzene. Therefore, MEG is presented as a safer alternative to ethylbenzene in this context.",

This indicates that biodiesel blends are associated with lower emissions of ethylbenzene, suggesting a safety advantage in terms of reduced exposure to ethylbenzene. Therefore, biodiesel blends can be reasonably interpreted as a safer alternative to ethylbenzene-containing conventional diesel fuel.",
