Phenolic Hydroxyl‐Activated Lignin for Preparation of Extreme Environments Adaptive Adhesives,10.1002/app.56728,2025,bisphenol A,"The abstract explicitly states that lignin exhibits enormous potential as an alternate for the health-risk compound bisphenol A in epoxy resin adhesives, implying a safer alternative. It highlights the use of lignin activated by a green deep eutectic solvent to prepare epoxy resins with good mechanical properties, suggesting a safety advantage over bisphenol A.",lignin,
Synthesis and Characterization of Eco‐Friendly Epoxy Resins and Novel Fillers for Enhanced Corrosion Protection of Mild Steel,10.1002/pat.70027,2024,bisphenol A,"The abstract explicitly states that bio-based epoxies using resorcinol and isosorbide, combined with novel fillers, offer an environmentally friendly, high-performance alternative to petroleum-based BPA epoxies. It highlights superior properties and eco-friendliness, indicating a safer alternative to bisphenol A.",resorcinol; isosorbide,
Bisphenol S Reduces Pig Spermatozoa Motility through Different Intracellular Pathways and Mechanisms than Its Analog Bisphenol A,10.3390/ijms24119598,2023,bisphenol A,"The abstract compares bisphenol S (BPS) to bisphenol A (BPA) and notes that BPS exerts a lower and slower negative effect on pig sperm motility than BPA. It also states that BPA causes decreases in sperm viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, while BPS does not affect these parameters. These differences indicate that BPS has a safer profile regarding sperm toxicity compared to BPA, suggesting BPS as a safer alternative.",bisphenol S (BPS),"reduction in sperm motility, decrease in sperm viability, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in cell reactive oxygen species, increase in mitochondrial reactive species, inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation, inhibition of PKA phosphorylation"
Optimización de la calidad del producto mediante la mejora del proceso de envasado en una empresa de leche envasada,10.15381/idata.v28i1.26727,2025,bisphenol A,"The abstract describes replacing a BPA-containing varnish with BPA-free varnishes from potential suppliers, aiming to eliminate BPA due to its impact on consumers. It highlights choosing a BPA-free varnish that preserves product properties without detectable negative effects, implying a safer alternative to BPA-containing varnish.",BPA-free varnishes,
Choosing the Right Lignin to Fully Replace Bisphenol A in Epoxy Resin Formulation,10.1002/cssc.202002729,2021,bisphenol A,"The abstract explicitly states that lignin samples were used to entirely replace bisphenol A (BPA) in epoxy resin formulations and refers to BPA as toxic, implying a safety concern. It highlights that lignins with certain properties are suitable for replacing 100% of toxic BPA, suggesting a safer alternative. Therefore, epoxidized lignin is presented as a safer alternative to BPA.",epoxidized lignin,
Study on the electrical properties of itaconic acid-based epoxy resin,10.1088/1742-6596/1986/1/012007,2021,bisphenol A,"The abstract compares bisphenol A epoxy resin (DGEBA) with itaconic acid-based epoxy resin (EIA) and suggests that EIA has the potential to replace DGEBA. It highlights that using bio-based epoxy resin reduces environmental pollution and petroleum resource consumption, implying a safety and environmental advantage over bisphenol A resin.",itaconic acid-based epoxy resin,
