It also reports that two substances, 5H-PFO and perfluoro-2-butyltetrahydrofuran, were non-cytotoxic at the highest tested concentrations, implying they have lower cytotoxicity than ethylbenzene.

It states that MEG is the best scenario in reducing BTEX emissions with efficient dew point control, implying a safety advantage by lowering harmful emissions compared to conventional methods involving ethylbenzene.
