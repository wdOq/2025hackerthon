Experimental evaluation of the mechanical and thermal properties of 3D printed PLA and its composites,10.1088/2053-1591/ab43ab,2019,acrylonitrile,"The abstract compares PLA and its composites to ABS and PC, noting PLA's superior mechanical properties and biodegradable nature, which reduces pollution and harm to human health. It explicitly states the focus on developing a polymer material that is safer and cleaner for applications. Since ABS contains acrylonitrile, PLA and its composites are presented as safer alternatives to acrylonitrile-containing polymers.",polylactic acid (PLA),
Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE): Potential Application for Assessing the Use of Conventional and New Generation Tobacco and Nicotine Products,10.2478/cttr-2025-0007,2025,acrylonitrile,"The abstract discusses the replacement of combustible cigarettes (CCs), which expose users to acrylonitrile, by tobacco-free nicotine products such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products and electronic cigarettes (ECs). It implies that these tobacco-free products reduce exposure to acrylonitrile, a combustion product, suggesting a safety advantage. Therefore, NRT products and ECs are presented as safer alternatives to acrylonitrile exposure from CC use.",nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products; electronic cigarettes (ECs),
Acute health effects of desktop 3D printing (fused deposition modeling) using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polylactic acid materials: An experimental exposure study in human volunteers,10.1111/ina.12458,2018,acrylonitrile,"The abstract compares emissions from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) in 3D printing, noting that PLA is low-emitting and ABS is high-emitting in terms of ultrafine particles. It reports fewer adverse effects (e.g., lower FeNO levels, less indisposition and odor nuisance) after PLA exposure compared to ABS. This suggests PLA may have safety advantages over ABS, which contains acrylonitrile, indicating PLA as a safer alternative.",polylactic acid (PLA),"eosinophilic inflammation from inhaled ultrafine particles, indisposition, odor nuisance"
New reaction route for bio-based adiponitrile production: Towards the rational design of the reactants and reaction pathways,10.1360/tb-2019-0311,2019,acrylonitrile,"The abstract presents a novel synthetic strategy for adiponitrile production using biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, which avoids the safety risks and pollution issues associated with current methods involving acrylonitrile. It explicitly states that this new method is green, sustainable, and safer compared to the traditional acrylonitrile-based processes.",5-hydroxymethylfurfural,
Investigation of the Effect of Exposure to Liquid Chemicals on the Strength Performance of 3D-Printed Parts from Different Filament Types,10.3390/polym17121637,2025,acrylonitrile,"The abstract compares the chemical resistance of various 3D printing filaments including acrylonitrile-based materials (ABS and ASA) and others like polypropylene (PP), PETG, and PLA. It states that PP exhibits the highest chemical resilience, retaining over 97% of mechanical properties after exposure to aggressive solvents, while ABS and ASA show moderate resistance and suffer deterioration in harsh conditions. This indicates that PP is a safer alternative to acrylonitrile-based filaments in terms of chemical resistance and durability in aggressive chemical environments.",polypropylene (PP),
Chemical valorization of waste polyacrylonitrile polymers via shuttle catalysis,10.1038/s41467-025-64384-0,2025,acrylonitrile,"The abstract presents a Pd-based shuttle catalysis process that valorizes acrylonitrile polymers without releasing harmful nitrogen gases such as HCN and NOx, which are associated with acrylonitrile. It describes this method as a safe, cost-effective alternative to commonly employed nitrile synthesis methods, implying a safety advantage over traditional acrylonitrile use. Therefore, it explicitly indicates a safer alternative related to acrylonitrile processing.",Pd-based shuttle catalysis process,"potential release of harmful gases such as HCN, potential release of harmful gases such as NOx"
