Isosorbide-Based Acrylic Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives Through UV-Cured Crosslinking with a Balance Between Adhesion and Cohesion,10.3390/polym16223178,2024,butyl acrylate,"The abstract presents a bio-based acrylic PSA derived from isosorbide and its derivatives as a promising replacement for traditional petroleum-based PSAs, including those based on butyl acrylate. It highlights the non-toxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable features of the bio-based PSA, which implies safety advantages over conventional butyl acrylate-based adhesives. Therefore, it explicitly indicates a safer alternative to butyl acrylate.",isosorbide-based acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives,
Hydration Mechanism in Blood-Compatible Polymers Undergoing Phase Separation.,10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c02672,2022,butyl acrylate,"The abstract compares blood-compatible poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) with non-blood-compatible poly(n-butyl acrylate), highlighting differences in water interactions and blood compatibility. It implies that poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) has superior blood compatibility, which can be reasonably interpreted as a safer alternative to butyl acrylate in this context.",poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate),
Water structure of poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,10.1080/09205063.2020.1738042,2020,butyl acrylate,"The abstract compares poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA) with poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA), noting that PMEA shows excellent blood compatibility while PBA exhibits poor blood compatibility. This implies a safety advantage of PMEA over PBA, which is a polymer of butyl acrylate, indicating PMEA as a safer alternative.",poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate),
