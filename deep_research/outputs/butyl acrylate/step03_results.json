The aim is to encapsulate enzymes in detergent formulations. The proposed method, with vegetable oil as the continuous phase, avoids the use of harmful organic solvents. Allura Red has been used as a water-soluble dye, in the core, to analyze the influence of variables such as sodium alginate and latex concentrations on the sealing and release profiles. After formation, the capsules were dispersed in either water or propylene glycol. The capsules have been examined using optical, confocal and scanning electron microscopies. Working with the highest sodium alginate concentration and latex volume the encapsulation efficiency is between 60% and 80%. Propylene glycol enables a better dispersion of the capsules compared with water. Dye release data have been fitted to exponential and Michaelis Menten type equations, leading to kinetic parameters which allow simulation of the release process.",

The research has a dual purpose, as it focuses on polymer physics, as well as on applied polymer processing. Results of dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, pressure–volume–temperature (PVT), and extrusion capillary tests were combined, to analyze the additivity of the free volume and the effect of frequency and pressure on the glass transition of the copolymers, Tg. Free volume additivity, which is on the basis of self‐plasticization, was revealed by Tg and activation energy of flow, Ea, results. dTg/dP results were linked to the number of segments involved in the glass transition temperature. Using an ad hoc model, which involves parameters obtained by PVT and the activation energy of flow, the pressure‐viscosity coefficient was determined. This allowed estimating the viscosity as a function of the shear rate, the temperature and the pressure, offering suitable data to be employed in virtual injection molding. J. VINYL ADDIT.

    "abstract": "A new approach to the formation of cross-linked colloidosomes was developed on the basis of Pickering emulsions that were stabilized exclusively by peroxidized colloidal particles. Free radical polymerization and a soft template technique were used to convert droplets of a Pickering emulsion into colloidosomes. The peroxidized latex particles were synthesized in the emulsion polymerization process using amphiphilic polyperoxide copolymers poly(2-tert-butylperoxy-2-methyl-5-hexen-3-ine-co-maleic acid) (PM-1-MAc) or poly[N-(tert-butylperoxymethyl)acrylamide]-co-maleic acid (PM-2-MAc), which were applied as both initiators and surfactants (inisurfs). The polymerization in the presence of the inisurfs results in latexes with a controllable amount of peroxide and carboxyl groups at the particle surface. Peroxidized polystyrene latex particles with a covalently grafted layer of inisurf PM-1-MAc or PM-2-MAc were used as Pickering stabilizers to form Pickering emulsions. A mixture of styrene and/or butyl acrylate with divinylbenzene and hexadecane was applied as a template for the synthesis of colloidosomes. Peroxidized latex particles located at the interface are involved in the radical reactions of colloidosomes formation. As a result, covalently cross-linked colloidosomes were obtained. It was demonstrated that the structure of the synthesized (using peroxidized latex particles) colloidosomes depends on the amount of functional groups and pH during the synthesis. Therefore, the size and morphology of colloidosomes can be controlled by latex particle surface properties.",

LDH intercalation allows the stability of organic dyes to be improved and their direct use in polymer melt blending. The prepared nanocomposites absorb sunlight from UV to visible and emit from blue to near‐IR and thus can be exploited for light‐energy management.

Dielectric elastomer (DE), the core component of DEA, with high output force and large actuation strain under relatively low driving electric field is critical for high‐performance DEA. However, the widely used VHB series (3M) DE suffered from very large pre‐strain and high driving voltage to get their high actuation performance, limiting their scope of application. In this work, the DEs with good mechanical and dielectric properties were prepared via UV curing method consisting of acrylic acid (AA) with strong polar groups as functional monomer, n‐butyl acrylate (BA) as soft monomer and urethane acrylate as cross‐linker (c‐p(BA‐AA)). The c‐p(BA‐AA) DE films obtained the simultaneous increasing of dielectric constant and breakdown strength with the increasing content of AA, which guaranteed the good actuation performance. The c‐p(BA‐AA) film exhibited excellent actuating performance (44.11% actuation strain at 45 kV/mm) without pre‐strain. Besides, a simple linear actuator based on the c‐p(BA‐AA) film could easily output weight that is tens of times of its own active weight (654.1 mN/g at 30 kV/mm).",

    "abstract": "The outstanding adhesive performance of mussel byssal threads has been a beacon of inspiration for materials scientists over the past few decades. Historically, presence of a significant amount of the unique catecholic amino acid dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) has been considered to play a key role in strong dry and wet adhesive properties of the byssal interfacial proteins. In recent years, molecular and microscopic level studies using short peptides or small molecule analogs have investigated the roles of other amino acids in mussel adhesion. In particular, these studies have highlighted the cohesive role of cation-π interactions as well as the adhesive synergy between Dopa and flanking lysine residues. Inspired to design advanced synthetic adhesives that exploit amino-catechol synergy, we synthesized polymeric pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) by copolymerizing traditional PSA monomers, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid, with mussel-inspired lysine- and aromatic-rich monomers. Of particular interest was to compare the consequences of decoupling amino and catechol moieties from each other (i.e. incorporated as separate monomers) versus a monomer architecture in which the catechol and amine were coupled together in a fixed orientation in the monomer side chain. Comprehensive multi-scale adhesion assays were used to probe performance at the molecular, microscopic and macroscopic levels through a combination of AFM-assisted force spectroscopy, peel and static shear adhesion. We showed that coupling of catechols and amines together within the same monomer side chain produced optimal cooperative effects in improving macroscopic adhesion performance. The findings in this study improve our understanding of underlying principles of mussel adhesion and provide a solid framework for rational design of high-performance bioinspired adhesives.",

However, few adhesives have been formulated specifically for the needs of cultural heritage. This article describes a study of the stability of ethylene butyl acrylate copolymers as well as blends of these polymers with low molecular weight resins, which may be used as consolidating adhesives for flaking and fragile paint layers. The materials were aged under simulated museum conditions. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography were used to analyze changes in chemical structure and molecular weight distribution, respectively. The degree of degradation was found to be dependent on the specific blend composition. With the addition of a hindered amine light stabilizer, minimal changes occurred in the molecular weight distribution and no loss in polymer solubility were noted. Therefore, it is suggested to incorporate a stabilizer into ethylene butyl acrylate polymer blends to extend their life and safe use in cultural heritage. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to investigate the miscibility of the binary blends and the temperature window of their application. Furthermore, adhesive peel strength for the individual components and the binary mixtures revealed values comparable to that of Paraloid™ B-72, a frequently used consolidant. Consolidation tests on the blends were done by professional conservators on mock up and dummy paintings.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Intermediate water (IW) is known to play an important role in the antifouling property of biocompatible polymers. However, how IW prevents protein adsorption is still unclear. To understand the role of IW in the antifouling mechanism, molecular dynamics simulation was used to investigate the dynamic properties of water and side-chains for hydrated poly(ω-methoxyalkyl acrylate)s (PMCxA, where x indicates the number of methylene carbons) with x = 1-6 and poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) in this study. Since the polymers uptake more water than their equilibrium water content (EWC) at the polymer/water interface, we analyzed the hydrated polymers at a water content higher than that of EWC. It was found that the water molecules interacting with one polymer oxygen atom (BW1), of which most are IW molecules, in PMC2A exhibit the lowest mobility, while those in PBA and PMC1A show a higher mobility. The result was consistent with the expectation that the biocompatible polymer with a long-resident hydration layer possesses good antifouling property. Through the detailed analysis of side-chain binding with three different types of BW1 molecules, we found that the amount of side-chains simultaneously interacting with two BW1 molecules, which exhibit the highest flexibility among the three kinds of side-chains, is the lowest for PMC1A. The high mobility of BW1 is thus suggested as the main factor for the poor protein adsorption resistance of PMC1A even though it possesses enough IW content and relatively flexible side-chains. Contrarily, a maximum amount of side-chains simultaneously interacting with two BW1 molecules was found in the hydrated PMC3A. The moderate side-chain length of PMC3A allows side-chains to simultaneously interact with two BW1 molecules and minimizes the hydrophobic part attractively interacting with a protein at the polymer/water interface. The unique structure of PMC3A may be the reason causing the best protein adsorption resistance among the PMCxAs.",

Subsequently, the copolymers underwent hydrolysis to synthesize vinyl ether-maleic acid (VEMA) copolymers with different tail structures. The nBA block yielded VEMA extended with an acrylic acid (AA) block after hydrolysis. The tBA block gave VEMA extended with a mixture of tBA and AA blocks. This study investigates the effect of VEMA hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity and monomer structure in the second block on the formation and properties of self-assembled lipid nanodiscs. In particular, the size of the polymer-lipid discs and their interaction with a model membrane protein, KCNE1. The findings indicate that both AA and tBA/AA VEMA blocks yield lipid discs, however copolymers with tBA/AA blocks tend to form relatively larger lipid nanodiscs potentially due to steric differences in the copolymer tail. The change in hydrophobicity of VEMA block copolymers affects the resulting dimensions of lipid nanodiscs; similarly, the type of lipid also influences the size of lipid discs. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) studies revealed that these block copolymers do not affect the structural dynamics of the KCNE1 protein, confirming their suitability for membrane protein studies in native-like environments. This study demonstrates the compatibility of VEMA-block copolymers with membrane protein systems by enabling control over the size of lipid discs.

Proteins and peptides purified from microorganisms or synthesized chemically are weakly antigenic and need adjuvant to provide strong immune responses. Many substances with adjuvant properties have been discovered, however, only aluminum compounds stay traditionally in clinical use. The aim of this study was to evaluate biological influence on mice after immunization with a polymer of acrylic acid with adjuvant properties. The polymer was synthesized on the basis of glycidyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, triethylene glycol methacrylate and butyl acrylate. Histomorphology of the liver, kidney and spleen of white mice after subcutaneous administration of polymer or aluminum hydroxide was investigated. It has been established that the polymer and aluminum hydroxide did not cause changes in parenchymal organs of white mice. The structure of organs was preserved, no pathological changes were revealed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes — superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutation reductase (GP) at the application of adjuvants were studied. Immunization of mice with aluminum hydroxide showed an increase in the activity of SOD in the kidneys by 1.5 times (P<0.01), catalase in liver on 8 % (P<0.05), and GP in kidney on 30.6 % (P<0.001). Polymer based on acrylic acid caused a decrease of SOD activity in the liver by 1.78 times (P<0.01), and an increase of catalase activity on 10.5 % (P<0.05). At the same time, the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the spleen and kidneys of animals after the injection of the polymer did not differ from the control group.",

    "abstract": "Commodity copolymers offer many useful applications, and their durability is critical in maintaining desired functions and retaining sustainability. These studies show that primarily alternating styrene/n-butyl acrylate [p(Sty/nBA)] copolymers self-heal without external intervention when monomer molar ratios are within the 45:55-53:47 range. This behavior is attributed to the favorable interchain interactions between aliphatic nBA side groups being sandwiched by aromatic rings forming ring-and-lock associations driven by pi-sigma-pi (π-σ-π) interactions. Guided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with spectroscopic and thermomechanical analysis, the ring-and-lock interchain van der Waals forces between π orbitals of aromatic rings and sigma components of aliphatic side groups are responsible for self-healing. Despite the frequent occurrence of these interactions in biological systems (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and polysaccharides), these largely unexplored weak and ubiquitous molecular forces between the soft acid aliphatic and soft base aromatic electrons may be valuable assets in the development of polymeric materials with sustainable properties.",

    "abstract": "The emulsion polymerization of vinyl monomers has been extensively researched, but copolymerization with crotonic acid or cinnamic acid is relatively uncommon. These acids are capable of coordinating with other metal ions. Our previous research has focused on synthesizing and characterizing copolymers of butyl acrylate (BuA)/vinyl acetate (VAc) and styrene-BuA using emulsion techniques, specifically for paint applications. The current work aimed to synthesize and characterize three binary chelating copolymers of styrene with maleic, cinnamic, and crotonic acids. In addition, the prepared chelating copolymers were treated with water and soluble salts of copper and iron for complex formation. Additionally, the characterization and electrical properties of these copolymers were investigated. This article reports the synthesis of three binary copolymers of styrene with cinnamic, crotonic, and maleic acids via an emulsion polymerization process using a redox initiation system of potassium persulfate/glucose in the presence of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate as an emulsifier. The prepared emulsions of the copolymers were precipitated and purified using Soxhlet extraction in a mixture of n-hexane and toluene. Spectroscopic measurements, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), in addition to thermal analysis methods like thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed to characterize the copolymers that were synthesized. The metal complexes of the chelating copolymers were prepared by treatment with soluble metal salts of Co(II), Cu(II), and Fe(III), purified, and characterized via IR, PXRD, TGA, and DSC. The semiconducting properties of the chelating polymers and their metal complexes were demonstrated through conductivity measurements taken at room temperature. The conductivity values ranged from 10−3 to 10−6 Ω−1 cm−1. The research underscores the significance of the electrical characteristics of chelating copolymers and their metal complexes, particularly focusing on styrene-based binary chelating copolymers, in driving advancements in technology, science, and economic development.",

The sizing properties of BBES-g-P(AA-co-BA) were estimated in comparison with acid-hydrolyzed starch (AHS) and BBES.

And the increased grafting ratio exhibited positive effects on these properties of BBES-g-P(AA-co-BA). The properties containing increase in strength, loss in extension, abrasion resistance and hairiness of polyester and polyester/cotton blended yarns sized with BBES-g-P(AA-co-BA), were superior to those sized with AHS and BBES, respectively, indicating that the incorporation of P(AA-co-BA) branches onto BBES could further promote the sizing qualities of both yarns.

    "abstract": "This study presents a solvent-free, facile synthesis of a bio-based green antibacterial agent and aromatic monomer methacrylated vanillin (MV) using vanillin. The resulting MV not only imparted antibacterial properties to coatings layered on leather, but could also be employed as a green alternative to petroleum-based carcinogen styrene (St). Herein, MV was copolymerized with butyl acrylate (BA) to obtain waterborne bio-based P(MV–BA) miniemulsion via miniemulsion polymerization. Subsequently, MXene nanosheets with excellent photothermal conversion performance and antibacterial properties, were introduced into the P(MV–BA) miniemulsion by ultrasonic dispersion. During the gradual solidification of P(MV–BA)/MXene nanocomposite miniemulsion on the leather surface, MXene gradually migrated to the surface of leather coatings due to the cavitation effect of ultrasonication and amphiphilicity of MXene, which prompted its full exposure to light and bacteria, exerting the maximum photothermal conversion efficiency and significant antibacterial efficacy. In particular, when the dosage of MXene nanosheets was 1.4 wt%, the surface temperature of P(MV–BA)/MXene nanocomposite miniemulsion-coated leather (PML) increased by about 15 °C in an outdoor environment during winter, and the antibacterial rate against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was nearly 100% under the simulated sunlight treatment for 30 min. Moreover, the introduction of MXene nanosheets increased the air permeability, water vapor permeability, and thermal stability of these coatings. This study provides a new insight into the preparation of novel, green, and waterborne bio-based nanocomposite coatings for leather, with desired warmth retention and antibacterial properties. It can not only realize zero-carbon heating based on sunlight in winter, reducing the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions, but also improve ability to fight off invasion by harmful bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.",

On the evening of 23 July 2022 (Beijing time), a titan arum in the north garden of the China National Botanical Garden in Beijing bloomed. In order to determine the components and contents of volatile compounds released by the titan arum during its flowering, the dynamic headspace adsorption method was utilized to collect the odor of the titan arum flower on the evening of 23 July (S1), the morning of 24 July (S2), the afternoon of 24 July (S3) and the evening of 24 July (S4). The volatile compounds were analyzed by automatic thermal desorption–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Sixty-three volatile compounds were detected in the titan arum flower in four periods. The comparison of the total volatile compounds released in four periods was S2 > S3 > S1 > S4. The highest content of volatile compounds in the S1 period were sulfur compounds (dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide), and the sulfur compounds were released in large amounts only in the S1 period. Dimethyl disulfide was the volatile substance with the highest content in the S1 period (20.00%). The total volatile compounds content of titan arum flower in the S2 period was the highest among the four periods. From the S2 period, the relative content of sulfur compounds decreased significantly until the S4 period. Compared with the S1 period, 1-butanol and butyl acrylate increased significantly and 1-butanol became the highest relative component of volatile compounds in the S2 period. After the S3 period, the total amount of volatile compounds began to decline and reached the lowest level in the S4 period. It is worth noting that the contents of two terpenes, α-pinene and γ-terpinene, rose from the S1 period until their height in the S3 period. From the S4 period, the contents of most volatile compounds decreased significantly. This study revealed the varieties and contents of volatile compounds in the titan arum flower at different flowering periods. The changing trend and physiological significance of dimethyl oligosulfide from the evening of flowering (S1) to the second day (S2–S4) were emphatically discussed, and this research also provides a reference for the study of the release of volatile compounds and the molecular biology of the flower fragrance of titan arum.",

    "abstract": "Block copolymer templating enables the generation of well-defined pore sizes and geometries in a wide variety of frameworks, typically through evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA). Here, we systematically modulate the solvent quality with mixtures of tetrahydrofuran-ethanol (THF-EtOH) to manipulate the unimer:micelle ratio in the precursor solution to explore how the associated solution structure influences the final porous morphology. A bottlebrush block copolymer (BBCP) with polyethylene oxide (PEO) and poly(t-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) side chains was used as the template for pore formation. Irrespective of the solvent composition, a bimodal pore size distribution was obtained with mesopores templated by small aggregates of the BBCP unimers (potentially low aggregation number micelles) and macropores templated by large self-assembled BBCP micelles. The morphology and pore characteristics of the metal oxide films were dependent on the THF-EtOH composition. Interestingly, an intermediate solvent composition where the volume of micelles is approximately half the volume of unimers (in the precursor solution) leads to the best ordering of micelle-templated pores and also the maximum porosity in the films. The micelle/unimer ratios in the precursor solutions do not correspond directly to the bimodal pore distribution in the metal oxide films, which we attribute to kinetically trapped assembly of the BBCP at low THF content. The increased critical micelle concentration (CMC) at high THF composition leads to changes in the unimer/micelle ratio during solvent evaporation. These results appear to be universal for a number of metal oxides (cobalt, magnesium and zinc) with the porosity maximized at a THF:EtOH ratio of 3:1. These results suggest the potential for enhancements in the porosity of block copolymer templated films by EISA methods through judicious solvent selection.",

Analysis of samples removed from reactions, together with analysis of film cross‐sections by atomic force microscopy (AFM), confirms the core‐shell particle structures and honeycomb morphologies in films, with simultaneous AFM and infrared spectroscopy showing the distribution of hydrazone crosslinks. Increasing wt.% DAAM (i.e., degree of crosslinking) in the percolating phase shifts film tensile stress–strain curves towards higher stresses and lower extensions at break. For core and shell copolymer Tgs of 5 °C there is a small effect of core wt.%. At 70 and 80 wt.% core, increasing core copolymer Tg also shifts the curves towards higher stresses and lower extensions at break.

    "abstract": "Architecture-transformable polymers with rational rearrangement of the chain structure may reshape the future of smart materials. Although the transition from block to multisegmented block copolymers is well documented, further transformation into high-order architectures has been scarcely revealed. This research aims at reaction-induced sequential transitions from ABA triblock copolymers (TBPs) to multisite (MMPs), single-chain-folding (SMPs) and branched (BMPs) multiblock copolymers. Consecutive ATRP and azidation afford α,ω-azido-mid-anthryl-functionalized ABA (A = poly(tert-butyl acrylate), B = polystyrene) copolymers, the double-strain-promoted azide−alkyne cycloaddition reaction gives (ABA)n-type MMPs, and UV-induced dimerization of pendant anthryl groups is adopted to generate SMPs or BMPs. The utilization of the self-accelerating click reaction and anthracene chemistry allows efficient construction of the desired polymers in a few hours, affording a robust platform for fast formation and transformation of MMPs. Fractional precipitation endows MMPs with relatively low dispersity and weight-average polymerization degree of ABA (nw) up to 72. With the formation of a more compact structure, the single-chain folding is prone to result in reduced apparent molar mass relying on dispersity and nw as well as decreased solution viscosity. The success of this study paves the way for on-demand transformation and tunable properties of multisegmented macromolecular architectures.",

All topologies possessed similar molar mass are confirmed using 1H NMR, FT‐IR, SEC, and MALDI‐TOF mass spectrometry. The influence of macromolecular topology on intrinsic viscosity and glass transition temperature (Tg) is systematically investigated. The findings show that within the PtBA topology series, Tg increases with structural compactness, with cyclic polymers exhibiting higher Tg than their precursors. Additionally, intrinsic viscosity decreases as compactness increases across the various topological macromolecules.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "When surface-active molecules or particles assemble at fluid–fluid interfaces, these interfaces acquire complex rheological properties that are of importance in processes that involve flow and deformation of interfaces. Although much progress has been made, interfacial rheology measurements and, in particular, the measurement of interfacial rheological properties of polymers at the air-water interface remain challenging. These are due to weak interactions with the water subphase, the polymer backbone conformation, the glass transition of the interfacial layer, and memory effects. In the present work, we describe systematic rheological measurements of polymer-laden interfaces. The measurements were performed with four different interfacial shear rheometers that can be classified into two types: rheometers in which the surface pressure can be controlled independently, and devices based on fixtures mounted on standard rotational rheometers and lacking control of the surface pressure. We use poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate), two high glass transition temperature, hydrophobic polymers anchored to the water subphase by means of the acrylate group. Using a Langmuir–Pockels (LP) trough, we identify the transition of the polymer monolayer from a viscous to a solid elastic or soft-glassy interface as the polymer surface concentration increases by compression. Then, we compare the linear viscoelastic properties of the interface as obtained by each rheometer. Our results show poor reproducibility and comparability of the rheological data as obtained by different rheometers for the same polymer. This is mainly due to differences in the method used to prepare the layers. For LP-based devices, spreading under dilute conditions and subsequent compression yields layers of compressed glassy blobs with reproducible results. On the other hand, for devices without surface pressure control, deposition of the amount needed to reach a desired concentration may lead to the formation of ill-defined layers resulting in irreproducible data. Furthermore, we find that only when spreading the polymer to form a dilute layer and then controlling the surface pressure by compression, we can clearly distinguish the fluidlike from solidlike interfaces, and a clear correlation is observed between the surface pressure (or interfacial polymer concentration) and the rheological properties of the interface.",

Despite the biomedical potential of triple-SMPs, a triple-SMP that with cells present can undergo two different shape changes via two distinct cytocompatible triggers has not previously been demonstrated. Here, we report the design and characterization of a cytocompatible triple-SMP material that responds separately to thermal and light triggers to undergo two distinct shape changes under cytocompatible conditions. Tandem triggering was achieved via a photothermally triggered component, comprising poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers with graphene oxide (GO) particles physically attached, embedded in a thermally triggered component, comprising a tert-butyl acrylate-butyl acrylate (tBA-BA) matrix. The material was characterized in terms of thermal properties, surface morphology, shape-memory performance, and cytocompatibility during shape change. Collectively, the results demonstrate cytocompatible triple-shape behavior with a relatively larger thermal shape change (an average of 20.4 ± 4.2% strain recovered for all PCL-containing groups) followed by a smaller photothermal shape change (an average of 3.5 ± 0.8% strain recovered for all PCL-GO-containing groups; samples without GO showed no recovery) with greater than 95% cell viability on the triple-SMP materials, establishing the feasibility of triple-shape memory to be incorporated into biomedical devices and strategies.",

The critical effect in a two‐year inhalation study with rats was reserve cell hyperplasia with loss of ciliated or olfactory cells at the lowest concentration of 15 ml/m\n            3\n            . The lower confidence limit of the benchmark dose for an extra risk of 5% increase of the critical effect incidence (BMDL\n            05\n            ) of about 3 ml/m\n            3\n            , which had been calculated in the previous evaluations, was confirmed. Since 2014, the Commission uses an empirical approach to set MAK values for substances with critical effects on the upper respiratory tract or the eyes. Based on this approach, the equivalent concentration at the workplace is 1.5 ml/m\n            3\n            . However, studies in humans to investigate the sensory irritation of n‐butyl acrylate are lacking. As the structurally related ethyl acrylate possesses a RD\n            50\n            value as well as subchronic and chronic NOAECs similar to those of n‐butyl acrylate, the NOAEC of 2.5 ml ethyl acrylate/m\n            3\n            for sensory irritation in volunteers was used as a read‐across. As the MAK value for ethyl acrylate has been set at 2 ml/m\n            3\n            , the MAK value of 2 ml/m\n            3\n            for n‐butyl acrylate could be confirmed. In analogy to ethyl acrylate, the assignment of n‐butyl acrylate to Peak Limitation Category I and the excursion factor of 2 were confirmed. The NOAECs for developmental toxicity in rats and mice are sufficiently high so that damage to the embryo or foetus is unlikely when the MAK value is observed. Thus, n‐butyl acrylate continues to be classified in Pregnancy Risk Group C. The substance is marginally clastogenic in vitro but not in vivo and was not carcinogenic in a 2‐year inhalation study in rats. There are only a few cases of contact sensitization in humans but there are positive results in local lymph node assays. Data on airway sensitization are still not available. n‐Butyl acrylate continues to be designated with “Sh”. Skin absorption was calculated to contribute significantly to the systemic toxicity and n‐butyl acrylate is designated with an “H”.",

Herein, a highly efficient multifunctional linen fabric finishing agent was developed with nano-ZnO, dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate, vinyl trimethoxysilane, methyl methacrylate, and butyl acrylate as raw materials. The finishing agent imparted linen fabric multiple performance characteristics such as hydrophobic, antibacterial and ultraviolet protection. Infrared spectroscopy analysis, particle size test and transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze the main characteristics of multifunctional linen fabric finishing agent, including the main groups, particle size distribution and particle morphology. The results showed that the nano-ZnO/fluorosilicone-polyacrylate emulsion finishing agent had been successfully prepared, and the finishing agent had good stability. By means of scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, and X-ray diffractometry, it was found that the finishing agent successfully covered the surface of the linen fabric, which increased the thermal decomposition temperature of the linen fabric and reduced the crystallinity of the linen fabric, indicating that improved the heat stability and softness of the fabric. Similarly, the application performance of linen fabric was tested. Compared with the original linen fabric, the finished linen fabric had good ultraviolet protection, antibacterial, hydrophobicity, washing fastness and breaking strength, leading to the improvement of the wear performance of linen fabric.

Diffusion of the self-healing copolymer additive into damage regions drove the recovery after damage, along with the restoration of structural color due to the materials hyperuniform microstructure.

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "The paper reports studies of the effects of ester side-group size and structure on chain transfer to polymer (CTP) and mol% branches (%br) in the final polymers from monomer-starved semi-batch emulsion homopolymerizations of a series of alkyl acrylates with different numbers of ester OR side-group carbon atoms ( N sgC ) in the range 1–10. Although the high instantaneous conversions and high gel contents in the final polymers show that intermolecular CTP is significant, the kinetics have been analysed principally in terms of intramolecular CTP (intraCTP) because this is expected to be numerically the dominant CTP process. For linear OR side groups, there is a small, continuous increase in %br (from ~ 3.4 to ~ 5.0 mol%) as N sgC increases from 1 to 8, which arises predominantly from the acrylate molar mass ( M acrylate ) reducing the molar monomer concentration and from the small increase in rate coefficient for propagation ( k p ) as N sgC increases; no discernible effects of N sgC on the rate coefficient for intraCTP ( $${k}_{\\mathrm{trP}}^{\\mathrm{intra}}$$ k trP intra ) are evident. For isomeric butyl acrylates, there is no measurable effect of isomer structure on %br (4.3–4.4 mol%), indicating that butyl groups are too small for changes in side-group bulkiness to influence $${k}_{\\mathrm{trP}}^{\\mathrm{intra}}$$ k trP intra and k p . A similar observation was made for n -hexyl acrylate (nHA) and 2-ethylbutyl acrylate (%br 4.7–4.8 mol%). However, cyclohexyl acrylate (cHA) gives a much higher %br (~ 7.2 mol%), which has been assigned to steric effects increasing $${k}_{\\mathrm{trP}}^{\\mathrm{intra}}$$ k trP intra because k p values for nHA and cHA are very similar. For OR side-groups with N sgC of 8 and10, there is a strong effect of side-group non-linearity (2-ethylhexyl, iso -octyl and iso -decyl) increasing %br, with polymers from n -alkyl acrylates having much lower %br (~ 4.5–5.0 mol%) than those from the equivalent non-linear acrylates (~ 6.7–7.1 mol%); since the k p values are expected to be similar for these acrylates, it is evident that the much bulkier non-linear OR groups cause a significant increase in $${k}_{\\mathrm{trP}}^{\\mathrm{intra}}$$ k trP intra compared to the linear equivalents. Tentative hypotheses for these steric effects have been postulated. Studies of the effect of temperature (0–80 °C) on CTP and %br for methyl acrylate solution homopolymerization (in which intraCTP should be completely dominant) show the expected reduction in %br as temperature reduces, such that CTP is negligible at 0 °C; Arrhenius analysis gives an activation energy of 40.7 kJ mol −1 for intraCTP, which is within the range of values reported for n -butyl acrylate.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Dynamics of melts and solutions of high molecular weight polymers and biopolymers is controlled by topological constraints (entanglements) imposing a sliding chain motion along an effective confining tube. For linear chains, the tube size is determined by universal packing number Pe, the number of polymer strands within a confining tube that is required for chains to entangle. Here we show that in melts of brush-like (graft) polymers, consisting of linear chain backbones with grafted side chains, Pe is not a universal number and depends on the molecular architecture. In particular, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that the packing number is a nonmonotonic function of the ratio Rnsc/Rng of the size of the side chains Rnsc to that of the backbone spacer between neighboring grafting points Rng. This parameter characterizes the degree of mutual interpenetration between side chains of the same macromolecule. We show that Pe of brush-like polymers first decreases with increasing side chain grafting density in the dilute side chain regime (Rnsc < Rng), then begins to increase in the regime of overlapping side chains (Rnsc > Rng), approaching the value for linear chains in the limit of densely grafted side chains. This dependence of the packing number reflects a crossover from chain-like entanglements in systems with loosely grafted side chains (comb-like polymers) to entanglements between flexible filaments (bottlebrush-like polymers). Our simulation results are in agreement with the experimental data for the dependence of a plateau modulus on the molecular architecture of graft poly(n-butyl acrylates) and poly(norbornene)-graft-poly(lactide) melts.",

In addition, rapid charge-discharge battery systems require electrolytes with high Na-ion transport properties. Herein, we demonstrate a stable and high-rate sodium-metal battery enabled by a nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solution composed of a weakly coordinating polyanion-type Na salt, poly[(4-styrenesulfonyl)-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (poly(NaSTFSI)) copolymerized with butyl acrylate, in a propylene carbonate solution. It was found that this concentrated polyelectrolyte solution exhibited a remarkably high Na-ion transference number (tNaPP = 0.9) and a high ionic conductivity (σ = 1.1 mS cm-1) at 60 °C. Furthermore, the surface of the Na electrode was modified with polyanion chains anchored via the partial decomposition of the electrolyte. The surface-tethered polyanion layer effectively suppressed the subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte, thereby enabling stable Na deposition/dissolution cycling. Finally, an assembled sodium-metal battery with a Na0.44MnO2 cathode demonstrated an outstanding charge/discharge reversibility (Coulombic efficiency >99.8%) over 200 cycles while also exhibiting a high discharge rate (i.e., 45% capacity retention at 10 mA cm-2).",

The hydrolysis of [Al(mbmp)Me]2 with water resulted in the formation of dimeric hydroxide [(O∼∼CH2∼∼O)AlOH]2, with phenol oxygen atoms adopting μ–η1-η2 mode. Single-crystal X-ray analysis showed a C2 axis of symmetry, which relates the coordination spheres of each Al center. Combining [Al(mbmp)Me]2 with commercially available Lewis bases, including phosphines and carbenes, afforded frustrated Lewis pairs, which were employed for methyl methacrylate (MMA) and n-butyl acrylate (nBA) polymerization. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) was polymerized at 25 °C in toluene in a high-speed manner (TOF = 2400 h−1) by [Al(mbmp)Me]2/PCy3 to give poly(methyl methacrylate) with high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn = 14 500 g mol−1, Mw/Mn = 1.1). MALDI-TOF Ms indicated the formation of both a cyclic chain end and linear chain end. The different requirements of Lewis acid (LA)/Lewis base (LB) matching for MMA and nBA polymerization were revealed by polymerization experiments. In contrast to MMA LPP, nBA LPP needs a weaker Lewis acid and stronger Lewis base to ensure the polymerization proceeds. In comparison with the monomeric Al Lewis and its counterpart phosphine LB in MMA polymerization, the bimetallic organoaluminum exhibited better control of molecular weight and molecular distribution of the resulting polymer and required only equal molar ratios of LA/LB to complete the polymerization.

In this study, PA6 was modified by poly(styrene‐alt‐maleic acid)‐block‐polystyrene‐block‐poly(n‐butyl acrylate)‐block‐polystyrene tetrablock copolymer (BCP) elastomer. The introduced acid groups in BCP resulted in the size of BCP inclusions down to nanometers in polyamide matrix. 10 wt % of BCP‐modified PA6 blends achieved five times increase in notched impact strength with almost no loss in modulus. Microscopic observations suggested the cavitation of elastomer particles and shear yielding of PA6 matrix to be the major toughening mechanism.

All rGO-PBMA composites with a filler fraction above 3 vol.% exhibited a distinct non-linear resistivity with increasing electric field; and it was confirmed that the resistivity could be tailored by changing the PBMA graft length or the rGO filler fraction. A combined image analysis- and Monte-Carlo simulation strategy revealed that the addition of PBMA grafts improved the enthalpic solubility of rGO in EBA; resulting in improved particle dispersion and more controlled flake-to-flake distances. The addition of rGO and rGO-PBMAs increased the modulus of the materials up to 200% and the strain did not vary significantly as compared to that of the reference matrix for the rGO-PBMA-2 vol.% composites; indicating that the interphase between the rGO and EBA was subsequently improved.

    "abstract": "Diesel fuel, which is widely used in engines, generators, and industrial equipment, is often adulterated with kerosene. The use of adulterated diesel fuel reduces the performance and durability of diesel–fuel-powered engines, causes environmental pollution, and promotes tax evasion. However, detecting kerosene in diesel using a high-precision instrumental technique such as gas chromatography with flame ionization detection is difficult because both diesel and kerosene contain C6–C16 paraffins. In this study, we developed a simple and reliable colorimetric sensor to detect various volumetric fractions of kerosene in diesel. A novel 15-layered one-dimensional photonic crystal (1D PC) was prepared using a photo-crosslinked butyl acrylate (BA)–based copolymer [P(BA-co-BPA)] as the low-refractive-index material and a photo-crosslinked copolymer–TiO2 hybrid (Ti70) as the high-refractive-index material. The P(BA-co-BPA) layers swelled to a greater extent in smaller-sized C6–C16 n-alkanes than in the larger ones. Consequently, the reflection colors of P(BA-co-BPA)/Ti70 PC underwent a greater red shift from the sky-blue color of the pristine state as the swelling increased from the C16 to the C6 n-alkanes. When immersed in pure diesel, the 1D PC exhibited a green color, which underwent a greater red shift as the volume fraction of kerosene increased from 10% (∼limit of colorimetric detection) to 100% in the kerosene + diesel mixtures. The 1D PC reached saturation within 45 min and changed color from the sky-blue corresponding to the pristine state to greenish yellow, yellow, yellow-orange, orange, and reddish orange in 10%, 20%, 30%, 50–70%, and 100% kerosene, respectively. Moreover, it exhibited recyclability in five swelling/deswelling cycles in diesel and kerosene. We expect that these findings will promote the development of simple and state-of-the-art 1D PC sensors.",

    "abstract": "To improve the stability of waterborne epoxy–acrylic emulsions and their comprehensive properties, such as the chemical resistance of coatings, a new research idea is proposed in this paper. First, a series of high-molecular-weight epoxy resins were synthesized with epoxy resin E-51 and bisphenol A (BPA) using benzyl triphenyl phosphine bromide as the catalyst. Then, free-radical graft copolymerization was carried out between the epoxy resin and methacrylic acid (MAA), styrene (ST), and butyl acrylate (BA) using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as the initiator. This method ensured that the epoxy groups were retained. Finally, the carboxylic acid groups were neutralized with N,N-dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), and a stable aqueous epoxy–acrylic emulsion was obtained by high-speed dispersion in deionized water. The effects of key factors such as temperature, time, the molecular weight and dosage of epoxy resin, the dosage of MAA, the dosage of BPO, and the neutralization degree of the synthesis of emulsions and coating film properties were mainly discussed. The molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the epoxy resin were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The epoxy resin and its graft copolymer were analyzed and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The particle size and distribution of the emulsions were tested by laser particle size analysis. The morphology of the emulsion particles was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the acrylic monomers (MAA, ST, and BA) were grafted onto the epoxy resin. The graft copolymers showed higher glass transition temperatures compared with those of the pure epoxy resin. TGA showed that the graft copolymer started to decompose at a high temperature before the pure epoxy resin did, and the thermal stability was slightly reduced. The prepared emulsions with a particle size of 160 nm had a storage stability of more than one year and showed excellent dilution stability, mechanical stability, and freeze–thaw stability. The emulsions were coated and cured at 150 °C for 1 h with a pencil hardness of 5 H, an adhesion of grade 1, and a flexibility of 1 mm.

Here we report a convenient and effective synthetic approach to a series of biomass-derived methylene butyrolactone monomers via a zinc-mediated allylation-lactonization one-pot reaction of biorenewable aldehydes with ethyl 2-(bromomethyl)acrylate. Under simple room-temperature sonication conditions, near-quantitative conversions (>90%) can be accomplished within 5–30 min, providing pure products with high isolated yields of 70–80%. Their efficient polymerizations with a high degree of control and complete chemoselectivity were enabled by the judiciously chosen Lewis pair catalyst based on methylaluminum bis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxide) [MeAl(BHT)2] Lewis acid and 3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene (IiPr) Lewis base, affording new poly(methylene butyrolactone)s with high thermal stability and thermal properties tuned in a wide range as well as pendant vinyl groups for postfunctionalization.

Three different molar concentrations of sulfonating agent (50, 100 and 150%) were considered to obtain the sulfonated copolymer (sSt-BuA) and membranes were casted from sSt-BuA copolymers. Copolymers were characterized with FTIR, TGA and NMR 1H and mechanically by TMA. The sSt-BuA sulfonation degree (SD) effect on the ion-exchange capacity (IEC) was evaluated by titration and water uptake (WU) by gravimetry. Microstructure was also observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and its electrochemical properties were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The chemical composition of St-BuA copolymer was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR 1H) spectroscopy. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis also confirmed the existence of both comonomers and a successful sulfonation up to an actual 30% level, as well as a good thermal stability over 300 °C for the molecular structure and over 150 °C for sulfonated membranes. TMA indicate an increase in flexure modulus along degree of sulfonation. SEM images show a highly dense material with low pore size for the sulfonated copolymer. The IEC values obtained varied from 0.83 to 1.18 meq g−1, depending on sulfonation degree.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of wearable devices is in urgent demand for materials with switchable adhesion both in air and aqueous environments. Herein, we report a thermoresponsive ionogel with switchable adhesion against various substrates both in air and aqueous environments. The switchable adhesion of ionogels is realized by a phase separation induced collapse of the polymer network and the subsequent extrusion of ionic liquids (ILs) on ionogel surfaces. The hydrophobic poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) network and ILs endow the ionogels with excellent water-resistance ability, which enables the application of ionogels in aqueous environments. As a result, the adhesion strength of ionogels against rubber can reach an on/off ratio of 75-fold (45 kPa versus 0.6 kPa) and 7.7-fold (21 kPa versus 2.7 kPa) in air and aqueous environments, respectively. By varying the ratio of two structurally similar ILs in their blends, the responsive temperature of ionogels can be tuned within a wide temperature range from 32 °C to 100 °C. Furthermore, we show a demonstration of an underwater on demand capture and release by taking advantage of the switchable adhesion of ionogels.

Copolymer compositions were obtained using related proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) spectra, and the polydispersity of the copolymers was determined by gel permeation chromatography.

All the prepared polymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared and1H NMR spectroscopic techniques. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of all copolymers before and after modification was determined by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). It was shown that chemical modification of MAN copolymers with 2-amino ethyl benzoate substituents as side chains decreased the free volume of the polymers, and therefore, the rigidity and Tg are increased.",

    "abstract": "Directing self-assembly of photopolymerizable systems is advantageous for controlling polymer nanostructure and material properties, but developing techniques for inducing ordered structure remains challenging. In this work, well-defined diblock or random copolymers were incorporated into cationic photopolymerizable epoxy systems to investigate the impact of copolymer architecture on self-assembly and phase separated nanostructures. Copolymers consisting of poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate)-x-(butyl acrylate) were prepared using photoiniferter polymerization to control functional group placement and molecular weight/polydispersity. Prepolymer configuration and concentration induced distinctly different effects on the resin flow and photopolymerization kinetics. The diblock copolymer self-assembled into nanostructured phases within the resin matrix, whereas the random copolymer formed an isotropic mixture. Rapid photopolymerization and ambient temperature conditions during cure facilitated retention of the self-assembled phases, leading to considerably different composite morphology and thermomechanical behavior. Increased loading of the diblock copolymer induced long-range ordered cocontinuous structures. Even with nearly identical prepolymer composition, controlled nanophase separation resulted in significantly enhanced tensile properties relative to those of the isotropic system. This work demonstrates that controlling phase separation with a block copolymer architecture allows access to nanostructured photopolymers with unique and enhanced properties.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "AbstractSignificant improvements in the butyl acrylate production have emerged with process intensification strategies that combine reaction and separation processes in the same equipment. Meanwhile, a new approach based on process re‐intensification concept has been addressed. This was accomplished by combining two different separation processes with reaction, in this case, membrane pervaporation and simulated moving bed technology, with reaction, giving rise to the simulated moving bed membrane reactor (PermSMBR) technology. In this work, the PermSMBR was significantly enhanced by removing the extract stream and, consequently, reducing the number of operating sections, from four to three (PermSMBR‐3s), leading to a considerable reduction of the eluent consumption by 98% and improving the productivity by 34%. Additionally, the scaling up of the PermSMBR‐3s at industrial scale is also addressed considering a competitive production capacity, 50 000 tBAc·year−1. With that, a reduction of 56% in the eluent consumption was obtained relatively to the simulated moving bed reactor at the same scale, with a significant productivity enhancement of 49%. Moreover, a brief economic analysis showed that this process presents an economic potential of 491 €·tBAc−1. Since this value is inside of the range obtained for other process intensification strategies (454‐593 €·tBAc−1) presented in the literature, so far, PermSMBR‐3s seems to be a very promising and competitive strategy for butyl acrylate manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "A random poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) [P(MMA-co-BA-co-AA)] was synthesized via emulsion polymerization utilizing thermally-activated persulfate radicals. The successful synthesis of high molecular weight copolymer at high monomer conversion rate was confirmed by NMR study. Various techniques were employed to characterize the structure, electrical and thermal properties of copolymer. The removal of unreacted monomers from the end product by casting technique was rationalized from the disappearance of CC FTIR characteristic peak in the cast film. The drying of the emulsion above the glass transition temperature (T\n                     g\n                     =24°C) yields an amorphous film with smooth surface morphology. The suitability of the formed continuous film as a base polymer for iodide-based electrolytes in dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) fabrication was investigated. The polymeric solid state electrolytes (PSSE) were formulated by varying the doping concentrations of sodium iodide (NaI) in fixed ratio of iodine (I2) and mixtures of ethylene carbonate: propylene carbonate (EC:PC, 1:1). The DSSC fabricated using PSSE with 15wt.% NaI showed the highest solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) of 3.22% under 100mWcm−2 sunlight intensity. This implies that the physico-chemical properties of the synthesized copolymer are suitable for the development of photoelectrochemical device.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The Diels–Alder reaction is a prototypical example of a thermally allowed [4 + 2] cycloaddition with good control over the regio- and stereochemical outcomes. Therefore, Diels–Alder reactions in which adjacent stereocenters are generated at the two ends of the newly formed single bonds imply two different possible stereochemical outcomes. In cases where the dienophile has a single electron-withdrawing substituent, the outcome can often be predicted by applying the known “endo rule”. Furthermore, the use of chiral eutectic solvents in asymmetric synthesis has become a novel tool to maintain sustainability in organic synthesis. In the present work, a set of recyclable and sustainable bio-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) was designed using hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) with a chiral center. These compounds were used in their racemic and enantiomerically enriched forms to prepare DESs with lactic acid (LA), glycerol (Gly), and ethylene glycol, which act as hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) in the corresponding eutectic mixture. These DESs were used as solvents to study the reaction between cyclopentadiene and ethyl acrylate or butyl acrylate in typical [4 + 2] cycloadditions. The best yields and endo-selectivity were achieved using LA as the HBD in the eutectic mixtures. The results and adduct ratios obtained show that these DESs were able to improve both reaction yields and selectivity when compared to those observed in organic solvents or ionic liquids. Moreover, the reaction products (adducts) were easily recovered with diethyl ether from the reaction mixture, where they appeared as an upper layer.",

Maximum tensile stress sharply increased because of chemical cross‐linking via poly(TBA), whereas tensile breaking strain slightly diminished by the grafted poly(TBA). Percent shape recovery at 10°C rapidly increased by the additional grafting of poly(TBA), whereas control series decreased with increases in TBA monomer content. Chemical cross‐linking from the grafted poly(TBA) was responsible for the enhancement of shape recovery. Low‐temperature flexibility tests from −35°C demonstrated that a proper composition of grafted poly(TBA) could enhance the flexibility of PU below 0°C. Overall, the grafted poly(TBA) greatly stepped up the maximum tensile stress, recovery capability to original form, and flexibility of PU at very low temperature.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to prepare new cellulose derivatives that show good feasibility and processability. Accordingly, in this study, we demonstrate Michael addition to hydroxyalkyl acrylates, that is, 2-hydroxyethyl and 4-hydroxybutyl acrylates (HEA and HBA, respectively), to synthesize amorphous cellulose derivatives under alkaline conditions. The reactions were carried out in the presence of LiOH in ionic liquid (1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride)/N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvents at room temperature or 50 °C for 1 h. The Fourier transform infrared and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the products supported the progress of Michael addition; however, the degrees of substitution (DS) were not high (0.3–0.6 for HEA and 0.6 for HBA). The powder X-ray diffraction analysis of the products indicated their amorphous nature. The cellulosic Michael adduct from HEA with DS = 0.6 was swollen with high polar organic liquids, such as DMF. In addition to swelling with these liquids, the cellulosic Michael adduct from HBA was soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), leading to its 1H NMR analysis in DMSO-d6. This adduct was found to form a cast film with flexible properties from its DMSO solutions. Furthermore, films containing an ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, showed thermoplasticity. The Michael addition approach to hydroxyalkyl acrylates is quite effective to totally reduce crystallinity, leading to good feasibility and processability in cellulosic materials, even with low DS. In addition, the present thermoplastic films will be applied in practical, bio-based, and eco-friendly fields.",

Even after removal from surfaces, they retain insoluble networks which pose problems during the recycling of glass and cardboard. Herein, degradable PSAs are presented that provide the required performance in use but have networks that can be degraded after use. A series of copolymers was prepared through radical copolymerization of n-butyl acrylate, 4-acryloyloxy benzophenone (ABP) photo-crosslinker, and dibenzo[c,e]oxepin-5(7H)-thione (DOT) to provide degradable backbone thioesters. The optimum tack and peel strengths were found for molar contents of 0.05 mol% ABP and 0.25 mol% DOT. Degradation of the backbone thioesters through aminolysis or thiolysis led to the full dissolution of the networks, loss of adhesive properties of films (decreases in the measured tack and peel strengths), and the quick detachment of model labels from a substrate. Inclusion of DOT into PSAs offers a viable route toward degradable and recyclable packaging labels.",

The comprehensive scattering analysis gives details and insights to the micellar architecture through structural parameters. Furthermore, this analysis provides direct clues for structural stabilities in micelles, which can be used as a good guideline to design highly stable micelles. Interestingly, in water, all topological polymers are found to form ellipsoidal micelles rather than spherical micelles; more interestingly, the cyclic polymer and its linear triblock analog make oblate-ellipsoidal micelles while the linear diblock analog makes a prolate-ellipsoidal micelle. The analysis results collectively inform that the cyclic topology enables more compact micelle formation as well as provides a positive impact on the micellar structural integrity.",

The PAA brushes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, ellipsometry and water contact angle analysis. The interaction of the PAA brushes with human serum albumin (HSA) was studied for a range of ionic strengths and pH conditions by quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The quantitative analysis showed a strong adsorption of protein molecules onto the PAA brush. By increasing the ionic strength, we were able to release a fraction of the initially bound HSA molecules. This finding highlights the importance of counterions in the polyelectrolyte-mediated protein adsorption/desorption. A comparison with recent calorimetric studies related to the binding of HSA to polyelectrolytes allowed us to fully analyze the QCM data based on the results of the thermodynamic analysis of the binding process.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "The disassembly of well-defined random copolymer nanoparticles to unimers at precise times can be programmed through the strong interaction with the surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The random copolymers consisted of thermoresponsive and self-degradable monomer units, rapidly self-assembled in water above the lower critical solution temperature of the thermoresponsive polymer component into SDS-stabilized polymer nanoparticles at a high weight fraction of polymer, a fully reversible process. Increasing the SDS concentration resulted in an increase in the nanoparticle size from ∼60 to ∼500 nm while maintaining a very narrow particle size distribution. These particles once formed were stable even under highly dilute conditions (i.e., an ∼10-fold dilution). Due to the self-catalyzed hydrolysis of the (N,N-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate) (DMAEA) to acrylic acid within the polymer, the nanoparticles rapidly disassembled back to unimers when the LCST of the hydrolyzed polymer was equal to or greater than the set solution temperature of 37 °C. The time to disassembly from nanoparticle to unimer was programmed through the amount of hydrophobic (butyl acrylate or styrene) units in the copolymer in combination with the amount of SDS. The higher hydrophopic content in the polymer resulted in longer disassembly times, while the higher SDS concentration reduced the disassembly time. Importantly, the self-catalyzed hydrolysis property of PDMAEA was not affected by SDS, allowing precise tunability of the time required for disassembly of the polymer nanoparticles. This active disassembly of nanoparticles provides a unique system that responds without an external trigger (e.g., light, heat, etc., ...) and could find applications where timed-release of compounds or timed activation of enzymes and other biocomponents is required.",

Here, an analysis in this direction is conducted for two water-insoluble biocompatible polymers, poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) and cyclic(poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate)), and a non-biocompatible polymer, poly(n-butyl acrylate), by measuring their IR spectra under humidified conditions and by carrying out theoretical calculations on model complex systems. It is found that the OH stretching bands of water are decomposed into four components, and while the higher-frequency components (with peaks at ∼3610 and ∼3540 cm–1) behave in parallel with the C=O and C–O–C stretching and CH deformation bands of the polymers, the lower-frequency components (with peaks at ∼3430 and ∼3260 cm–1) become pronounced to a greater extent with increasing humidity. From the theoretical calculations, it is shown that the OH stretching frequency that is distributed from ∼3650 to ∼3200 cm–1 is correlated to the hydrogen-bond configurations and is mainly controlled by the electric field that is sensed by the vibrating H atom. By combining these observed and calculated results, the configurations of water at the interface of the polymers are discussed.",

In the current study, fluorescent pigment latex (FPL) was prepared via mini‐emulsion polymerization and further applied on cotton fabric printing in the absence of binder. The mini‐emulsions were prepared by dispersing the fluorescein in the monomers methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl acrylate (BA) with DNS‐86 as emulsifier, hexadecane as co‐emulsifier, and ammonium persulfate as initiator. The Fourier‐transform infrared‐attenuated total refraction, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis showed that the fluorescein was successfully encapsulated into P(MMA‐co‐BA) and the polymer content was 91.22%. The surface morphology study revealed that compact and smooth film was formed onto the surface of FPL printings, which resulted in better hand feel and rubbing fastness as compared to the conventional printings with a large amount of binder. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Approximately 15% of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) cases are associated with Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) gene mutations, which play a crucial role in myofilament organization and contractile behavior. Previous studies have highlighted the role of dynamic mechanical stress in myofibril alignment in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSCCMs). In this study, we employed thermo-responsive shape memory polymers (SMPs) to mimic the dynamic mechanical environment of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and investigated their impact on myofibril assembly in healthy wild-type (WT) and BAG3 knockout (BAG3-/-) hiPSC-CMs We synthesized Tert-Butyl Acrylate (TBA) and Butyl acrylate (BA)-based SMP substrate. hiPSC-CMs were cultured on 30oC on 40% strained (dynamic) and un-strain (static) SMPs for two days before proceeding with polymer recovery at 37oC. Myofibril components of BAG3 knock-out (KO) and WT CMs were evaluated by immunocytochemistry fluorescent images at 5 hours and 24 hours after triggering the shape changes of the SMP substrate. We quantified Z-lines and M-lines of hiPSC-CMs to evaluate sarcomere remodeling on static and dynamic substrates. Our findings revealed that BAG3-/- hiPSC-CMs exhibited persistent Z-line disruption in sarcomeres compared with WT hiPSC-CMs, but M-line structures were less sensitive to mechanical stress at 5 hours, highlighted a temporal distinction in the assembly and regulation of Z-lines over M-lines. While no significant changes were detected at 5 hours, BAG3-/- CMs exhibited similar impairments in M-line organization as seen with Z-lines. These findings suggest that M-lines in BAG3-/- CMs display heightened sensitivity to dynamic mechanical actuation, but this phenotype emerges only after prolonged culture. This study highlights the interplay between genetic deficiency and mechanical stress to facilitate disease progression in BAG3-associated DCM.",

Continued challenges to lignin valorization, however, include poor solubility in organic solvents and in aqueous solutions at neutral pH. Herein, an alkaline tolerant laccase was used to graft acrylate functionalities onto softwood kraft lignin, which is expected to enhance the reactivity of lignin with isocyanate when producing bio-based polyurethanes. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to confirm successful grafting of the acrylate monomer onto lignin and verify the importance of including tert-butyl hydroperoxide as an initiator in the grafting reaction. Laccase-mediated grafting of softwood kraft lignin under alkaline conditions produced lignin products with approximately 30% higher hydroxyl value and higher reactivity toward isocyanate. The reported enzymatic and aqueous process presents an opportunity for the sustainable valorization of softwood kraft lignin. • Softwood kraft lignin displayed high phenolic hydroxyl content, polydispersity index and average molecular weight • Grafting hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) monomer onto kraft lignin by laccase was successful at 60 °C and alkaline conditions • Lignin-HEA grafted copolymer showed an increase in total OH value and an increase in average molecular weight",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "A high solids (about 30 wt %) water-borne acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) was prepared by emulsion polymerization using graphene oxide (GO) as a particulate surfactant and a random poly(n-butyl acrylate-stat-acrylic acid) copolymer, P(n-BA-stat-AA), as an auxiliary polymeric surfactant, thereby avoiding the colloidal instability commonly observed with conventional low-molecular-weight surfactants. FT-IR, Raman, and XPS analyses confirmed a sequential \"adsorption-grafting-encapsulation\" mechanism. P(n-BA-stat-AA) first adsorbs onto GO via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction, then may partially grafts through radical reactions, and is finally encapsulated by the growing polymer shell. This process partially restored the π-π stacking and incorporated GO as cross-linking nodes. The resulting latex has a narrow modal particle diameter of about 200 nm and remains stable for several months. Incorporating 4 wt % GO increased the 180° peel strength to 19.11 N/25 mm, extended the shear holding time from 3 to 1388 min, and raised the shear-adhesion-failure temperature from 50.8 to 115.6 °C, demonstrating simultaneous improvements in adhesion, cohesion, and heat resistance. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed delayed backbone degradation and reduced mass-loss rates, confirming the thermal-shielding and diffusion-barrier effects of the layered filler. Overall, these findings establish a clear structure-property relationship: electrostatic repulsion from GO and steric hindrance from P(n-BA-stat-AA) together generate a nanoconfined hybrid network, imparting exceptional mechanical durability and thermal stability.

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "In this thesis, different theoretical approaches designed to study a wide interval of length- and/or time-scales have been used to examine the microscopic properties of chemical systems with varying degrees of complexity and size. Firstly, the conformational preferences and optical properties of a tripeptide derived from the RGD sequence, the unit of a cell adhesive activity domain in adherent proteins, have been analyzed. Calculations on this peptide, which contains an exotic amino acid bearing a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) ring as side group, have been performed using DFT and time depending DFT methods. Results indicate that the bioactive characteristics of the RGD sequence become unstable in presence of the new residue because of both the steric hindrance caused by the EDOT side group and the repulsive interactions between the oxygen atoms belonging to the backbone amide groups and the EDOT side group. This information has been used to propose some chemical changes oriented to improve the bioadhesive properties. The interaction of a cell penetrating tetrapeptide, RPAR, adsorbed onto a gold substrate and the deposition of a pre-assembled peptide-polymer conjugate, cyc[(L-Gln-D-Ala-L-Lys-D-Ala)2] coupled with two poly(n-butyl acrylate) blocks, onto a mica substrate have been examined through molecular dynamics (MD). Results indicate that RPAR binds both the (100) and (111) gold surface facets. The conformation of the adsorbed peptide differs considerably from the bioactive conformation. However, the new conformations are not stabilized by strong intramolecular interactions. Accordingly, gold nanoparticles can be considered as suitable vehicles for the transport and targeted delivery of this CendR peptide. For the pre-assembled peptide-polymer conjugate, a theoretical approach that simulates the selective and progressive desolvation of the nanotube-like assembly has been used, demonstrating that the solvent presence during deposition is the main responsible for the unexplained conformational preferences of the acrylate blocks. When the proportion of solvent drops, the loss of many attractive solute-solvent interactions induces a meaningful increase in the number of torsions. MD has been also used to understand the impact of the solvation medium and the action of a detergent in the structure of a representative outer membrane protein (OMP). Calculations show the destabilization of the protein in water, while in presence of detergent molecules in solution or the bilayer induce a partial and complete protective effect, respectively. Combining stochastic algorithms and MD simulations the atomistic details of polymer coatings deposited over metal surfaces have been modeled to reproduce the experimentally observed topographic features of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT, deposited onto stainless steel. Results have provided an excellent model system to test the developed modeling strategy. Multi-phasic simulations have been conducted to explain the influence of protein···polymer interactions in the antimicrobial biocapacitors activity of lysozyme (LYZ)-containing PEDOT electrodes through atomistic MD calculations. Two models have been investigated: i) a biphasic system in which the protein was adsorbed onto the surface of PEDOT, PEDOT/LYZ; and ii) a biocomposite in which the LYZ was homogeneously distributed inside the PEDOT matrix, P(EDOT-LYZ). MD simulations have been performed in absence and presence of electric fields, the latter mimicking the one originated by the voltage cell difference in biocapacitors. In PEDOT/LYZ electrodes, the loss of biological activity has been attributed to the anisotropy of the PEDOT···LYZ electrostatic interactions. In contrast, anisotropic effects are minimized in P(EDOT-LYZ), conserving activity. The bactericidal activity of PEDOT/LYZ and P(EDOT-LYZ) biocapacitors is independent of the electric field applied or supplied during charge-discharge processes.\n En esta tesis, diferentes métodos diseñados para estudiar un amplio intervalo de tamaños y/o escalas de tiempo han sido usados para examinar las propiedades microscópicas de sistemas químicos con diferentes grados de complejidad y magnitud. Primeramente, se han analizado las preferencias conformacionales y las propiedades ópticas de un tripéptido derivado de la secuencia RGD, el dominio de actividad adhesiva en proteínas adherentes. Los cálculos de este péptido, que contiene un aminoácido exótico que porta un anillo de 3,4-etilendioxitiofeno (EDOT) como grupo lateral, han sido llevados a cabo usando métodos de DFT y DFT dependiente del tiempo. Los resultados indican que las características bioactivas de la secuencia RGD se vuelven inestables en presencia del nuevo residuo debido tanto a los impedimentos estéricos causados por el EDOT de la cadena lateral como por las interacciones repulsivas entre los átomos de oxígeno de los grupos amida que pertenecen a la cadena principal del péptido y del grupo lateral de EDOT. Esta información ha sido utilizada para proponer algunos cambios en la composición química orientados a mejorar las propiedades bioadhesivas. La interacción de un tetrapéptido permeabilizador vascular, RPAR, que ha sido adsorbido sobre un sustrato de oro y la deposición de un conjugado péptido-polímero pre-ensamblado, cyc[(L-Gln-D-Ala-L-Lys-D-Ala)2] unido a dos poli(n-butil acrilatos), sobre un sustrato de mica han sido examinados a través de dinámica molecular (MD). Los resultados indican que RPAR se une tanto a las caras (100) y (111) del oro. La conformación del péptido adsorbido difiere considerablemente de la conformación bioactiva. Aún así, las nuevas conformaciones no son estabilizadas por fuertes interacciones intramoleculares. De acuerdo a estos resultados, las nanopartículas de oro pueden ser consideradas como vehículos indicados para el transporte y liberación selectiva de este péptido CendR. Para el conjugado péptido-polímero pre-ensamblado, se ha usado un método teórico que simula la desolvatación progresiva del nanotubo, demostrando que la presencia del solvente durante la deposición es el principal responsable para las preferencias conformacionales inexplicadas de los bloques acrílicos. Cuando la proporción de solvente cae, la pérdida de muchas interacciones atractivas entre soluto y solvente induce un significante aumento en el número de torsiones. También se ha usado MD para entender el impacto del medio solvente y la acción de un detergente en la estructura de una proteína de membrana exterior (OMP) representativa. Los cálculos muestran la desestabilización de la proteína en agua, mientras que la presencia de moléculas de detergente en solución o en bicapa inducen un efecto protector parcial y completo, respectivamente. Combinando algoritmos estocásticos y simulaciones de MD, se ha modelado los detalles a nivel atómico de los recubrimientos de poli(3,4-etilendioxitiofeno), PEDOT, sobre acero inoxidable para reproducir las propiedades topográficas observadas experimentalmente. Los resultados han proporcionado un modelo excelente para probar la estrategia de modelado desarrollada. Se han realizado simulaciones multifásicas para explicar la influencia de las interacciones proteína-polímero en la actividad antimicrobiana de los condensadores que contienen electrodos lisozima (LYZ)-PEDOT, a través de cálculos de MD atomísticos. Dos modelos se han investigado: i) un sistema bifásico en los que la proteína ha sido adsorbida sobre la superficie de PEDOT, PEDOT/LYZ; y ii) un biocompuesto en el que la LYZ ha sido distribuida homogéneamente dentro la matriz de PEDOT, P(EDOT-LYZ). Las simulaciones de MD se han realizado tanto en ausencia como en presencia de campos eléctricos, el último para simular los originados por la diferencia de voltaje en los biocondensadores. La iso- y aniso-tropía de las interacciones son claves para la conservación",

These materials have been characterized by dynamic thermo‐mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Nona(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (EG9MEA) is used as the main monomer. The corresponding homopolymer has a very low Tg but exhibits a crystalline phase up to 0°C. This phenomenon is inhibited by copolymerizing EG9MEA with another monoacrylate (butyl acrylate or 4‐hydroxybutyl acrylate). The thermo‐mechanical stability initially sought is obtained by using 4‐hydroxybutyl acrylate at a rate above 30% by weight. The mechanical properties of EG9MEA‐based materials have been adjusted by the addition of a diacrylate monomer that increases the elastic modulus on the rubbery plateau, while being reduced by introducing a transfer agent. Finally, an experimental behavior law is proposed to predict the elastic modulus on the rubbery plateau as a function of the mass proportion of EG9MEA, diacrylate, and transfer agent initially introduced.",

    "abstract": "In this current study, the antidiabetic effectiveness of Hibiscus sabdariffa and its protective function against Fe2+ -induced oxidative hepatic injury were elucidated using in vitro, in silico, and ex vivo studies. The oxidative damage was induced in hepatic tissue by incubation with 0.1 mMolar ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) and then treated with different concentrations of crude extracts (ethyl acetate, ethanol, and aqueous) of H. sabdariffa flowers for 30 min at 37°C. When compared to ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts, the ethanolic extract displayed the most potent scavenging activity in ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and nitric oxide (NO) assays, with IC50 values of 2.8 μl/ml, 3.3 μl/ml, and 9.2 μl/ml, respectively. The extracts significantly suppressed α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities (p < .05), with the ethanolic extract demonstrating the highest activity. H. sabdariffa significantly (p < .05) raised reduced glutathione (GSH) levels while simultaneously decreasing malondihaldehyde (MDA) and NO levels and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity in Fe2+ induced oxidative hepatic injury. The extract of the plant inhibited intestinal glucose absorption and increased muscular glucose uptake. The extract revealed the presence of several phenolic compounds when submitted to gas chromatography-mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) screening, which was docked with α-glucosidase and α- amylase. The molecular docking displayed the compound 4-(3,5-Di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)butyl acrylate strongly interacted with α-glucosidase and α-amylase and had the lowest free binding energy compared to other compounds and acarbose. These results suggest that H. sabdariffa has promising antioxidant and antidiabetic activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In recent years, there has been increased concern about the side effects of synthetic anti-diabetic drugs, as well as their expensive cost, especially in impoverished nations. This has instigated a radical shift towards the use of traditional plants, which are rich in phytochemicals many years ago. Among these plants, H. sabdariffa has been used to treat diabetes in traditional medicine. In this present study, H. sabdariffa extracts demonstrated the ability to inhibit carbohydrate digesting enzymes, facilitate muscle glucose uptake and attenuate oxidative stress in oxidative hepatic injury. Hence, demonstrating H. sabdariffa's potential to protect against oxidative damage and the complications associated with diabetes. Consumption of Hibiscus tea or juice may be a potential source for developing an anti-diabetic drug.",

    "abstract": "Recently the role of protein absorption in nanoparticle drug delivery has gathered significant attention as the protein corona can significantly decide on the fate of nanoparticles in the body. Although it is known that the surface chemistry will significantly influence the amount and type of bound protein, there is little known about the effect of surface roughness and surface topography on the interaction. In this work, we show how patchy nanoparticles can noticeably reduce the adsorption of proteins compared to spherical nanoparticles with a smooth surface as demonstrated using six ABC triblock terpolymers based on glucose, mannose and galactose. To obtain patchy nanoparticles, poly(2-d-sugar ethyl acrylate)-b-poly (n-butyl acrylate)-b-poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (PSugEA-b-PBuA-b-P4VP) was prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization and assembled into nanoparticles with a patch-like appearance and a hydrodynamic diameter of around 130-160 nm. As control, smooth nanoparticles were prepared from poly(2-d-sugar ethyl acrylate)-b-poly (n-butyl acrylate)-b-polystyrene (PSugEA-b-PBuA-b-PS). The patchy nanoparticles displayed significantly reduced protein absorption when exposed to serum-supplemented cell culture media, as observed using dynamic light scattering. The smooth particles, however, supported the formation of a large protein corona. Additionally, an enrichment of haemoglobin was observed in the corona compared to the serum protein in solution. The amount of albumin on the surface was observed to be dependent on the type of sugar with glucose resulting in the highest absorption. The protein corona led to cellular uptake that was unrelated to the underlying sugar, which was supposed to help targeting specific cell lines. This example demonstrated how the protein corona can override any attempts to target receptor expressing cells.",

    "abstract": "\n Recently, the stone building heritages in Putuo Zongcheng Temple are experiencing a certain degree of weathering damage, which mainly manifests in the blistering, fissuring, flaking and detachment of the carved balustrades of stone bridge, the footings of wall, the front paws and pedestals of stone lions. To prevent the deterioration of the stone building heritages, the fluorinated acrylate copolymer emulsion was successfully prepared with ethyl metrhacrylate, n-butyl acrylate and 2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl methacrylate as monomers. The structure and surface morphology characteristics of this copolymer were described the Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The FTIR spectra confirms that the adopted monomers have been involved in during the copolymer polymerization process. The SEM images reveal that the surface of the prepared copolymer is obviously more dense, compact and smooth than the porous structure of stone building heritages. The ageing resistance of the copolymer was quantitatively studied by the ultraviolet aging test, the contact angle and imbibition spontaneous tests were adopted to estimate the wettability alteration of the copolymer emulsion for the stone samples. Results show that the mass loss rate of the prepared copolymer increases rapidly and then tends to be stable when irradiated by ultraviolet light. And the fluorinated copolymer with 16.65% HFMA content possesses the optimal ageing resistance and the superb hydrophobicity. The contact angles of the coated stone samples range from 91.90o to 119.80o, which are all larger than 18.80o-69.05o of the un-coated samples. Similarly, the spontaneous imbibition test also ensures that, both the maximum water absorption capacity and the imbibition equilibrium time of the samples treated by this copolymer emulsion are lesser. Considering the influence of water on rock weathering, the fluorinated copolymer emulsion coating is an potential method to avoid the degrading of stone building heritages, because it depresses the infiltration of water and then avoids or weakens the dissolution effect, salt crystallization, water absorption swelling and freeze-thaw weathering.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "This work explores the mechanism whereby a cationic diimine Pd(II) complex combines coordination insertion and radical polymerization to form polyolefin-polar block copolymers. The initial requirement involves the insertion of a single acrylate monomer into the Pd(II)-polyolefin intermediates, which generate a stable polymeric chelate through a chain-walking mechanism. This thermodynamically stable chelate was also found to be photochemically inactive, and a unique mechanism was discovered which allows for radical polymerization. Rate-determining opening of the chelate by an ancillary ligand followed by additional chain walking allows the metal to migrate to the α-carbon of the acrylate moiety. Ultimately, the molecular parameters necessary for blue-light-triggered Pd-C bond homolysis from this α-carbon to form a carbon-centered macroradical species were established. This intermediate is understood to initiate free radical polymerization of acrylic monomers, thereby facilitating block copolymer synthesis from a single Pd(II) complex. Key intermediates were isolated and comprehensively characterized through exhaustive analytical methods which detail the mechanism while confirming the structural integrity of the polyolefin-polar blocks. Chain walking combined with blue-light irradiation functions as the mechanistic switch from coordination insertion to radical polymerization. On the basis of these discoveries, robust di- and triblock copolymer syntheses have been demonstrated with olefins (ethylene and 1-hexene) which produce amorphous or crystalline blocks and acrylics (methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate) in broad molecular weight ranges and compositions, yielding AB diblocks and BAB triblocks.",

To address the scale-up concern, a simple and highly effective synthesis of porous organic polymers from commercial building blocks/monomers is urgently needed.

The 2-step synthetic strategy includes hypercrosslinking of benzene units in PS and PtBA-b-PS chains and subsequent aminolysis reaction of the acrylate-unit in PtBA-b-PS chains by diamine compounds. The AHCPNPs demonstrate a well-defined microporous structure with a specific surface area of up to 507.64 m2 g−1 and an extreme capacity of 53.65 w% (12.21 mmol g−1) for carbon dioxide adsorption. The definite control over the particle size and porous properties of these AHCPNPs has been achieved by changing the BA/S ratio of the diblock copolymers and the mass ratio of PtBA-b-PS to PS.

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Stress-whitening is generally regarded as a sign of irreversible elasticity failure of polymer materials. Here, we report for the first time that in stark contrast to the conventional insight, the full range of stress-whitening occurs prior to a yield point and is even reversible, which can be applied to light intensity modulation. The reversibility of stress-whitening impeccably emerges in highly transparent nanocomposite films spontaneously formed during photocuring of poly(dimethylsiloxane-co-methylvinylsiloxane) solution in tert-butyl acrylate without any addition of nanofillers. This phenomeon is enabled by ‘elastic cavitation’ at soft elastomer matrix-hard nanoparticle interfaces. The film transmittance is readily controllable from ca. 80 to 0 % under small strain (e < 20 %) due to a high population of the nanoparticles, high initial modulus difference and low compatibility between the matrix and particles. The ratio of transmittance change to strain is as high as 3.7~8.0 depending on the wavelength in a visible region. A highly sensitive wearable strain sensor is demonstrated as an application of the unprecedented phenomenon. Our optical strain sensor rapidly, repeatedly responds in transmittance and reflectance to strain of around 0~40 % in accordance with human body motion. This work may initiate basic and technological research into various applications of the optically or electrically active element-free light intensity modulators which do not place limits on continuous shape-deformations.",

    "abstract": "New functional initiators for the cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-alkyl-2-oxazolines are described to introduce a thiol moiety at the α terminus. Both tosylate and nosylate initiators carrying a thioacetate group are obtained in multigram scale, from commercial reagents in two steps, including a phototriggered thiol-ene radical addition. The nosylate derivative gives access to a satisfying control over the cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline, with dispersity values lower than 1.1 during the entire course of the polymerization, until full conversion. Cleavage of the thioacetate end group is rapidly achieved using triazabicyclodecene, thereby leading to a mercapto terminus. The latter gives access to a new subgeneration of α-functional poly(2-oxazoline)s (butyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester, furan) by Michael addition with commercial (meth)acrylates. The amenability of the mercapto-poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) for covalent surface patterning onto acrylated surfaces is demonstrated in a microchannel cantilever spotting (µCS) experiment, characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS).",

    "abstract": "Nanocomposite filler particles provide multiple routes to mechanically reinforce pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs), as their large surface area to volume ratios provide a means of effectively crosslinking multiple polymer chains. A major advancement could therefore be enabled by the design of a particle architecture that forms multiple physical and chemical interactions with the surrounding polymer matrix, while simultaneously ensuring particle dispersion and preventing particle aggregation. Understanding how such multivalent interactions between a nanoparticle crosslinking point and the PSA polymer affect material mechanical performance would provide both useful scientific knowledge on the mechanical structure-property relationships in polymer composites, as well as a new route to synthesizing useful PSA materials. Herein, we report the use of polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs) composed of poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) chains grafted to SiO2 nanoparticle (NP) surfaces to cohesively reinforce PSA films against shear stress without compromising their adhesive properties. The use of acrylic acid-decorated PGNPs allows for ionic crosslinking via metal salt coordination to be used in conjunction with physical entanglement, yielding 33% greater shear resistance and up to 3-fold longer holding times under static load. In addition, the effects of material parameters such as PGNP/crosslinker loading, polymer graft length, and core nanoparticle size on mechanical properties are also explored, providing insights into the use of PGNPs for the rational design of polymer composite-based PSAs.",

Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) were used for structural confirmation and molecular weight characterization. This polymer exhibited responsive behavior from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity under the alkaline environment of cement-based materials, with the contact angle of 105.6°, a decreased evaporation rate, and a hydrophile–lipophile balance (HLB) value. A significant internal hydrophobic effect on cement mortar was shown in the water absorption rate, which decreased by 75.2%, and a dry shrinkage-reducing rate of more than 30%. Furthermore, this polymer can effectively slow the exothermic rate, reduce the heat release, and delay the exothermic peak of cement hydration. It was interesting that these properties showed a direct correlation with the side chain length of the comb polymer. The aims of this study are to provide a new avenue to synthesize polymers with the spontaneous hydrophilicity–hydrophobicity transition in the cement system, achieving excellent internal hydrophobicity of cement-based materials, and to offer a promising alternative to resist external erosion for improving the durability and service life of cement-based materials.",

The gradient structure in the AOST-tBA copolymer was produced by continuously adding a second monomer to the polymerization system to taper the copolymer composition. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis found a broad transition for the gradient copolymer, in contrast to a single narrow transition for the statistical copolymer and two narrow transitions for the block copolymer. The acetoxy groups from the AOST-tBA copolymers were de-acetylated to convert the AOST to hydroxystyrene (HOST). Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) studies revealed that the extent of hydrogen bonding in thin films of the HOST-tBA copolymers is greatly influenced by the copolymer composition as well as the chain structure.

The key ingredient in a KHI formulation is a water-soluble amphiphilic polymer. Recently, polymers of a new commercially available 5-ring vinylic monomer 5-methyl-3-vinyl-2-oxazolidinone (VMOX) were investigated as KHIs and shown to perform better than some commercial KHI polymers such as poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone). This initial study using slow constant cooling (SCC) in rocking cells with a synthetic natural gas has now been expanded to further explore low molecular weight PVMOX homopolymers and VMOX copolymers as well as blends with nonpolymeric synergists. A PVMOX homopolymer with improved KHI performance was found using 3-mercaptoacetic acid as a chain transfer agent in the radical polymerization of VMOX. Among a range of copolymers, VMOX:n-butyl acrylate copolymers in particular gave good KHI performance, better than the PVMOX homopolymer. Among the potential synergists, trialkylamine oxides (alkyl = n-butyl or iso-pentyl) and tetra(n-pentyl)ammonium bromide to 2500 ppm were found to be antagonistic with PVMOX at the test concentrations while some alcohols and glycols were synergetic. The best synergist was 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol (TMDD). For example, a mixture of 2500 ppm TMDD with 2500 ppm PVMOX (Mw 2400 g/mol) performed significantly better than 5000 ppm PVMOX. Addition of 1250 ppm TMDD to 2500 ppm VMOX:n-butyl acrylate 6:4 copolymer lowered the hydrate onset temperature in SCC tests by a further 3 °C compared to the copolymer alone giving hydrate onset at 4.2 °C.",

Water-in-toluene emulsions were formed at pH 4.0 and disrupted by increasing the pH to 10.0. The emulsion generation and disruption was reversible over the ten cycles investigated, and the bottlebrushes remained intact. The exceptional emulsion stability stemmed from the high interfacial binding energy of MBBs, imparted by their large molecular size and Janus architecture at the interface, as evidenced by the interfacial jamming and wrinkling of the assemblies upon reducing the interfacial area. At pH 10.0, PDEAEMA became water-insoluble, and the MBBs desorbed from the interface, causing de-emulsification.

General industrial pollutants, which includes volatile industrial pollutants (VIP) allyl chloride, butyl chloride, chloroacetonitrile, pentachloroethane, hexachloroethane, trans-1,4-dichloro-2-butene, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, 2-nitropropane, nitrobenzene , diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and carbon disulfide are widely used in the domestic chemical industry, but effective methods for the quantitative determination of their biomarkers in the biological media of chemical production workers have not yet been developed. \nThe purpose of the study is to develop a highly sensitive gas chromatographic technique for the determination of compounds of the VIP group in whole blood and urine for their biological control, and its testing using modeling of intoxication in laboratory animals. \nMaterial and methods. Experimental modeling of intoxication was carried out with subcutaneous (s/c) injection of toxicants to male chinchilla rabbits. Determination of biomarkers of toxicants was performed using a gas chromatograph with a single quadrupole mass analyzer (GC-MS) with preliminary extraction of components from the vapor phase above the sample by solid-phase microextraction. \nResults. A method for the determination of allyl chloride, butyl chloride, chloroacetonitrile, pentachloroethane, hexachloroethane, trans-1,4-dichloro-2-butene, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, 2-nitropropane, nitrobenzene, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and carbon disulfide in blood and urine was developed and metrologically certified. The achieved limits of quantification are no more than 1 ng/ml with a detection limit of 0.2 ng/ml in blood and urine. \nLimitations. Toxicokinetic parameters were experimentally determined on one animal species; allometric scaling was used for extrapolation to humans. \nConclusion. Analysis of the results of the assessment of the expected concentrations of VIP in blood and urine shows that biological control in the working area at the level of 0.5 MPC can be carried out for carbon disulfide, diethyl ether, butyl chloride, 1,4-dichlorobutene-2 and tetrahydrofuran in the study of blood and urine; methacrylonitrile and hexachloroethane (the lower value of the determination limit) – in the study of urine only. \nThe developed approaches to substantiate methods of biological control of harmful substances are a scientific and methodological platform for the introduction of biological MPC and ensuring the chemical safety of the Russian Federation.",

Three templates with a constant PMPEG segment length and different hydrophilic block volume fractions of 17%, 51%, and 68% for the PMPEG-PBA are cooperatively assembled with cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and citric acid. Irrespective of template composition, a spherical nanostructure is templated and elliptical mesostructures are obtained on calcination due to uniaxial contraction of the film. The average pore size increases from 11.4 ± 2.8 to 48.5 ± 4.3 nm as the length of the PBA segment increases as determined from AFM. For all three templates examined, a maximum in porosity (∼35% in all cases) and surface area is obtained when the precursor solids contain 35-45 wt % PMPEG-PBA. This invariance suggests that the total polymer content drives the structure through interfacial assembly. The composition for maximizing porosity and surface area with the micelle-templating approach results from a general decrease in porosity with increasing cobalt nitrate hexahydrate content and the increasing mechanical integrity of the framework to resist collapse during template removal/crystallization as the cobalt nitrate hexahydrate content increases. Unlike typical evaporation induced self-assembly with sol-gel chemistry, the hydrophilic/hydrophobic composition of the block copolymer template is not a critical component to the mesostructure developed with micelle-templating using metal nitrate-citric acid as the precursor.",

It was found that the water‐whitening resistance of the two groups of latex films was different. With the increase of AA content, the water whitening resistance of the latex films with higher Tg continued to improve, while that of the latex films with lower Tg increased first and then decreased. A series of characterizations, such as light transmittance, water whitening, water absorption, static water contact angle, surface morphology, and optical microscope test of the latex film, and so forth, showed that the reason for this difference was that under higher AA content (≥5%), compared with the polyacrylate latex films with lower Tg, the latex films with higher Tg could reach the saturation state of water absorption quickly, and water in these latex films exhibited continuous and large area distribution, rather than formation of many so‐called micro‐ or nano‐scale water sacs that can scatter light as found in the latex films with lower Tg.",

Various simulation models are used to predict the percolation threshold and the flake‐to‐flake distances, to complement the experimental results. A substantial increase in thermal stability of rGO is observed after surface modification, either by silanization or subsequent polymerizations. The non‐linear DC resistivity of neat and silanized rGO and its trapping of charge‐carriers in semi‐crystalline EBA are demonstrated for the first time. It is shown that the polymer‐grafted rGO improve the dispersibility in the EBA‐matrix and that the graft length controls the inter‐flake distances (i.e. charge‐carrier hopping distances). By the appropriate selection of graft lengths, both highly resistive materials at 10 kV mm‐1 and FGMs with a large and distinct drop in resistivity (six decades) are obtained, followed by saturation.

The study was conducted in two phases; in the first part, a series of unmodified blends with PLA content of 25, 50, and 75 wt.% was prepared, while the second part focused on the modification of the PLA/POM (50/50) blends. An ethylene/butyl acrylate/glycidyl methacrylate terpolymer (E/BA/GMA) elastomer (EBA) was used to improve the impact strength of the prepared blends, while reactive blending was used to improve interfacial interactions. We used a multifunctional epoxy chain extender (CE) as the compatibilizer. Static tensile tests and notched Izod measurement were used to evaluate the mechanical performance of the prepared samples. The thermomechanical properties were investigated using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) analysis and heat deflection temperature (HDT)/Vicat softening temperature (VST) methods. The crystallinity was measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXS) measurements, while the rheology was evaluated using a rotational rheometer.

The structural tests show partial miscibility of the POM/PLA systems, resulting in the perfect compatibility of both phases. The impact properties of the final blends modified by the EBA/CE system were found to be similar to pure POM resin, while the E modulus was visibly improved.

The polymerizations of n-butyl acrylate, methacrylic acid, and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate were examined to determine the generality of the trends across several monomers. It was found that the monomer flow rate significantly affected the pattern of the deposited polymer by shifting the location of the thickest point in the films.

The well-suited hydrophilic polymers to host GQDs can face an unavoidable swelling behavior, which deteriorates the mechanical stability, whereas the hydrophobic polymers can prevent swelling but at the same time barricade the analyte pathways to GQDs. To resolve the two aforementioned obstacles, we develop a nanocomposite film containing nitrogen-doped GQDs (NGQDs) incorporated into a transparent, elastic, and self-healable polymer matrix, composed of a hydrophobic n-butyl acrylate segment and a hydrophilic N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide segment for wearable healthcare pH sensors on the human body. Besides serving as the fluorescence source, NGQDs are also designed as a nano-cross-linker to promote abundant chemical and physical interactions within the nanocomposite network. This synergetic effect gives rise to a 10-fold higher mechanical strength, 7-fold increment in Young's modulus, 4-fold increment in toughness, and 15-fold more sensitivity in pH detection (pH 3-10) compared to those of the pristine copolymer and NGQDs, respectively. Moreover, the mechanically enhanced nanocomposite possesses a high self-healing efficiency (94%) at room temperature even under water and demonstrates a stable sensing performance after repetitive usage for 30 days.

These studies demonstrate dissociative substitution of the NCPh ligand in 1. Competition experiments using different secondary phosphine reagents provide a ranking of phosphine donor abilities at this relatively crowded half-sandwich complex: PEt2H > PPh2H ≫ PCy2H. The impact of steric congestion at Ru is evident also in reactions of 1 with tertiary phosphines; initial substitution products [Ru(η5-indenyl)(PR3)(PPh3)2]+ rapidly lose PPh3, enabling competitive re-coordination of NCPh. Further solution experiments, relevant to the use of 1 in catalytic hydrophosphination, show that PPh2H out-competes PPh2CH2CH2CO2Bu t (the product of hydrophosphination of tert-butyl acrylate by PPh2H) for coordination to Ru, even in the presence of a 10-fold excess of the tertiary phosphine. Additional information on relative phosphine binding strengths was obtained from gas-phase MS/MS experiments, including collision-induced dissociation experiments on the mixed phosphine complexes [Ru(η5-indenyl)PP'P″]+, which ultimately appear in solution during the secondary phosphine competition experiments. Unexpectedly, unsaturated complexes [Ru(η5-indenyl)(PR2H)(PPh3)]+, generated in the gas-phase, undergo preferential loss of PR2H.

Accordingly, both MCTs are promising drug targets for treatment of a variety of human cancers. The non-invasive imaging of these MCTs in cancers is regarded to be advantageous for assessing MCT-mediated effects on chemotherapy and radiosensitization using specific MCT inhibitors. Herein, we describe a method for the radiosynthesis of [18 F]FACH ((E)-2-cyano-3-{4-[(3-[18 F]fluoropropyl)(propyl) amino]-2-methoxyphenyl}acrylic acid), as a novel radiolabeled MCT1/4 inhibitor for imaging with PET. A fluorinated analog of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (FACH) was synthesized and the inhibition of MCT1 and MCT4 was measured via an L-[14 C]lactate uptake assay. Radiolabeling was performed by a two-step protocol comprising the radiosynthesis of the intermediate (E)/(Z)-[18 F]tert-Bu-FACH (tert-butyl (E)/(Z)-2-cyano-3-{4-[(3-[18 F]fluoropropyl)(propyl)amino]-2-methoxyphenyl}acrylate) followed by deprotection of the tert-butyl group. The radiofluorination was successfully implemented using either K[18 F]F-K2.2.2 -carbonate or [18 F]TBAF. The final deprotected product [18 F]FACH was only obtained when [18 F]tert-Bu-FACH was formed by the latter procedure. After optimization of the deprotection reaction, [18 F]FACH was obtained in high radiochemical yields (39.6 ± 8.3%, EOB) and radiochemical purity (>98%).",

Hydroxyterminated polybutadiene was used as a crosslinking agent. Influence of AA concentration (0–10 wt %) on kinetics of the cotelomerization process was investigated using a photodifferential scanning calorimetry method, selected physicochemical features of obtained photoreactive BA/AA/ABP cotelomers (molecular masses, polydispersity, monomers conversion and dynamic viscosity) and self-adhesive properties of obtained PSAs (adhesion, tack and cohesion) were studied, as well. It turned out that AA content is the important factor that influences monomers conversion (thereby the volatile parts content in prepolymer) and PSAs’ properties. As the acrylic acid content increases, the reaction rate increases, but the total monomers conversion and the solid content of the prepolymer decreases. Additionally, the adhesion and cohesion of PSAs were grown up, and their tackiness decreased. However, the AA content has no effect on molecular weights (Mw and Mn) and polydispersity (c.a. 1.5) of photoreactive cotelomers. The optimal AA content necessary to obtain a prepolymer with low volatile parts content and good PSA properties was determined.",

    "abstract": "The byssus-mediated adhesion of marine mussels is a widely mimicked system for robust adhesion in both dry and wet conditions. Mussel holdfasts are fabricated from proteins that contain a significant amount of the unique catecholic amino acid dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which plays a key role in enhancing interfacial adhesion to organic and inorganic marine surfaces, and contributes to cohesive strength of the holdfast. In this work, pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) were synthesized by copolymerization of dopamine methacrylamide (DMA) with common PSA monomers, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid, with careful attention paid to the effects of catechol on adhesive and cohesive properties. A combination of microscopic and macroscopic adhesion assays were used to study the effect of catechol on adhesion performance of acrylic PSAs. Addition of only 5% DMA to a conventional PSA copolymer containing butyl acrylate and acrylic acid resulted in a 6-fold and 2.5-fold increase in work required to separate the PSA from silica and polystyrene, respectively, and a large increase in 180° peel adhesion against stainless steel after 24 h storage in both ambient and underwater conditions. Moreover, the holding power of the catechol PSAs on both steel and high density polyethylene (HDPE) under shear load continuously increased as a function of catechol concentration, up to a maximum of 10% DMA. We also observed stark increases in shear and peel adhesion for the catecholic adhesives over PSAs with noncatecholic aromatic motifs, further underlining the benefits of catechols in PSAs. Overall, catechol PSAs perform extremely well on polar and metallic surfaces. The advantage of incorporating catechols in PSA formulations, however, is less straightforward for peel adhesion in nonpolar, organic substrates and tackiness of the PSAs.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of nucleic acid-based therapeutics is often hindered by nuclease degradation and poor cellular uptake. To address these challenges, the complexation with cationic polymers to form polyplexes has been increasingly investigated. In our previous work, we developed a platform technology composed of a mannosylated block for targeting dendritic cells (DCs) via endocytic mannose receptor (CD206), an agmatinyl block for nucleic acid condensation in diblock copolymers (M15-b-A12, M29-b-A25, and M58-b-A45), elongated with a poly(butyl acrylate) block to promote endosomal escape in triblock copolymers (M29-b-A29-b-B9 and M58-b-A52-b-B32). We exploited these copolymers to efficiently target DCs for cancer vaccination by delivering plasmid DNA encoding tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), using ovalbumin (pOVA) as a model antigen. However, successful T-cell activation requires an antigen presentation on DCs as major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-antigen complexes, along with immune stimulation, making vaccine adjuvants essential. In this study, we utilized mannosylated cationic copolymers to deliver cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) as a vaccine adjuvant and tested their effect in conjunction with pOVA to further enhance immune activation. Cationic glycopolymers efficiently condensed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), forming stable, predominantly spherical glycoplexes with sizes ranging from 20 to 40 nm, as assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. These mannosylated complexes showed high internalization by CD206-expressing cells. Confocal laser microscopy studies revealed rapid nuclear localization mediated by M58-b-A52-b-B32 triblock copolymer and slower endosomal escape for M58-b-A45 diblock copolymer-based glycoplexes. Furthermore, for M58-b-A45 diblock copolymer-based complexes, codelivering CpG and pOVA in the same particles induced stronger DC activation compared to coadministration of glycoplexes containing CpG and glycoplexes containing pOVA. These provide a structure–activity relationship for this class of mannosylated cationic glycopolymers for nucleic acid delivery to DCs and underscore the synergistic benefits of codelivering CpG and nucleic acid encoding TAAs for DC activation.",

Water was found to be more soluble in hydrated Z16 than Z2 because ZMA interacts strongly with H2O. In contrast, the diffusion coefficient of H2O in Z16 is lower than that of Z2 because H2O molecules are more constrained in the former due to strong ZMA/H2O interactions. Z16 was found to be significantly more permeable than Z2 over time. The SPC hydrated region in Z2 tends to expand toward the SPC region, while the analogous region in Z16 swelled toward both the SPC and H2O regions to leach SPC owing to the higher permeation of H2O into the SPC.

The aminated DNA probe for CaMV 35S was immobilized onto poly(n‐butyl acrylate) film modified with succinimide functional groups [poly(nBA‐NAS)] via peptide covalent bond. Nanosheets of rGO were entrapped in the poly(nBA‐NAS) film to form a conducting [poly(nBA‐NAS)‐rGO] film of the DNA biosensor. Besides facilitating the electron transfer reactions, the rGO also functioned as an adsorbent for AQMS. The sensing mechanism of the proposed DNA biosensor involved measuring the oxidation current of the AQMS adsorbed on the electrode surface at −0.50 V using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) before and after a DNA hybridization event.

Regarding the raw materials for polymerization, three types of commercial polyols with the same molecular weight (Mn = 1000 g/mol), namely, poly (butyl acrylate) (PBA), poly (tetramethylene ether) glycol (PTMG), and polycarbonate diol (PCDL) were used. These polyols were used in conjunction with butanediol and 4,4’-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. Three groups of TPUs were successfully synthesized using one-shot solvent-free bulk polymerization. Compared with TPUs polymerized using 1,4-BDO, materials polymerized using 1,3-BDO are more transparent and viscous. Structural analysis revealed that no substantial differences between the final structures of the TPUs were present when different chain extenders were used. Thermal analysis indicated that compared with TPUs polymerized using 1,4-BDO, the glass transition temperature of those with 1,3-BDO was 15 °C higher. Examination of microphase separation in the structure by using morphological analysis revealed that compared with TPUs synthesized using 1,4-BDO, PBA, and PTMG synthesized using 1,3-BDO were relatively separated. PCDL synthesized using 1,3-BDO exhibited no morphological difference. Rheological analysis indicated PCDL synthesized using either 1,4-BDO or 1,3-BDO did not exhibit any obvious differences. In conclusion, TPUs synthesized using PCDL and 1,3-BDO exhibited thermal plasticity at room temperature (15–20 °C). Their basic application could be extended to the development of smart materials. In terms of further application, they could be used in shape memory and temperature-sensitive high molecular polymers.",

    "abstract": "Reactive dye is widely used for cotton dyeing, but its low utilization results in vast amounts of colored effluent with high salinity discharge. Amino-modified Reactive Red 195/P(styrene-co-butyl acrylate-co-trimethyl(vinylbenzyl) ammonium chloride) nanospheres (Am-RPNs) are a kind of novel colorant that exhibit excellent dyeing ability for cotton fabrics and higher dye utilization than original reactive dyes. The colored polymer nanospheres demonstrated small size, high stability and dye content in the dispersion system when cationic polymer nanospheres were dyed at an optimal dye dosage of 100%. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the polymer nanospheres have smooth spherical shapes. Am-RPNs with an average hydration diameter of 96.5 nm and zeta potential of −33.7 mV were fabricated after being modified with ethylenediamine at pH 11. Both analytical techniques, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicated the presence of –NH2 on the surface of Am-RPNs. The amino-modification mechanism of the Reactive Red 195/P(styrene-co-butyl acrylate-co-trimethyl(vinylbenzyl) ammonium chloride) nanospheres depended on the dyeing bath pH. The color depths of the cotton fabrics dyed with Am-RPNs reached up to 3.1 times higher than those with Reactive Red 195. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that Am-RPNs form stable deposits on the surface of the modified fibers. The cotton fabrics dyed with Am-RPNs possessed excellent rubbing and washing fastness, satisfactory light fastness, and desirable handle. This study provides an innovative method that employ Am-RPNs with high coloration performance to endow the cotton fabric with deep color and good colorfastness without using inorganic salt.",

    "abstract": "Dielectric elastomers (DEs) are highly valued in massive fields of actuators and sensors due to their unique advantages of large actuation strain, fast response speed, high energy density and excellent elasticity. The challenge of balancing the elastic modulus, actuation strain and response speed of DE actuators to stably enhance the actuation performance remains a major issue. In this work, a novel DE was prepared by employing polyurethane acrylate (CN9021) as a crosslinker, n-butyl acrylate as a base monomer and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (2-EHA) as a functional flexible monomer via a UV curing method. The swelling test indicates a reduction of crosslinking density with the increment of 2-EHA concentration in EHA films. As a consequence, the elastic modulus displays a notable decline while the dielectric constant slightly rises, leading to an enhancement of the actuation sensitivity. More specifically, the elastic modulus of our fabricated EHA-1 is only one-third of the commercial VHB-4910. The developed DEs achieve an actuation strain of nearly 150% with low viscoelasticity and mechanical loss resulting in high response speed and broad operating frequency range to the input dynamic voltages. All these actuation performances are superior to VHB-4910. This work provides a promising strategy for developing DEs with balanced performance and superior actuation characteristics.",

The incorporation of degradable thioester bonds in polymethacrylates to achieve degradability/recyclability upon disposal is a challenge. Unfortunately, the most efficient thionolactone to insert cleavable thioester linkages does not copolymerize with methacrylates. We show that a small amount of the thionolactone can be inserted into polymethacrylates by the use of methyl acrylate or N-phenyl maleimide as an auxiliary third comonomer. We confirmed the selective degradation of the copolymer via aminolysis. The intriguing incorporation of the thionolactone via the formation of triads is demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations and such method is also used to optimize the synthesis conditions. Copolymers of 60,000 g.mol-1 is obtained that could be degraded with a 25-fold reduction of size, confirming the model-based insights and opening the pathway to degradability for polymethacrylates. This approach is also successfully extended to poly(butyl methacrylate), and water-soluble poly(oligo(ethyleneglycol) methacrylate) for biomedical applications.

    "abstract": "The influence of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) particle size on the performance of an intumescent formulation and on the synergistic action of a series of montmorillonite samples with different d‐spacings for the production of flame retardant composites was investigated. The polymer matrix employed was poly(ethylene‐co‐butyl acrylate), EBA 30, and the intumescent formulation consisted of APP and pentaerythritol (PER). After being processed, the composites were submitted to scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis, heating microscopy, and limiting oxygen index tests. The results indicate that the greater interaction between the APP and PER molecules, caused by the increase of the contact area promoted by the reduction of the APP particle size, could favor the esterification reaction between APP423 and PER, allowing the formation of a greater amount of char precursors in shorter period of time. In addition, the montmorillonite d‐spacings had a more pronounced influence on the clays synergistic action with the intumescent formulation containing the APP with smaller particle size. Microscopy has shown to be an important tool to investigate APP particle size effect on the fire retardancy. AFM results enabled the detection of nanometric particles in the sample containing the smallest particle size of APP. SEM micrographs showed that those nanometric particles were better dispersed in the matrix, interacting more effectively with the other components, a factor probably responsible for the superior fire retardancy results. Heating microscopy revealed that the material with smaller APP particle size did show some remaining structure at the temperature of 850°C.",

    "abstract": "\n A high-strength gel was prepared by crosslinking a high-concentration but low molecular weight polyacrylamide-tert-butyl acrylate (PAtBA) copolymer with polyethyleneimine (PEI), and the various factors affecting the gelling were systematically evaluated. The results showed that, besides the concentration of polymer and crosslinker, the molecular weight of PEI, pH value and salinity of gelant, and temperature all affected the gelation time, gel strength, and stability. High-strength PAtBA-PEI gels could be stable for more than 240 days in synthetic brine with salinity less than 43 530 mg/L at a temperature not higher than 130°C. However, when the temperature is higher than 150°C, the gel would be broken within 60 days. When the salinity in the synthetic brine was too high, the gel also exhibited syneresis at 110°C within 15 days. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that the syneresis of PAtBA-PEI gel under high-salinity conditions was caused by the reaction of carboxylate group generated by the hydrolysis of the amide group with divalent cations. In addition, Cryo-scanning electron microscope (Cryo-SEM) analysis showed that high-strength PAtBA-PEI gels had high crosslinking density and poor deformation ability. Nevertheless, the results of rheological tests and flooding experiments showed that the low deformation ability of the gel did not affect the sealing ability of the gel, and the high storage modulus and yield stress of the gel enabled it to exhibit high breakthrough pressure and residual resistance factor in the core.

The supported liquid gel electrolyte (SLG) material was characterised with thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and dynamic mechanical analysis, and was found to be stable with good mechanical properties.

The paints with structural colors are simply fabricated using monodispersed black disperse dye@poly(styrene–butyl acrylate–methacrylate) (P(St–BA–MAA)) microspheres via a rapid centrifugal treatment. Specifically, the centrifugal speeds and centrifugal times of dye@P(St–BA–MAA) microspheres are systematically optimized, and the apparent colors of prepared paints are simply characterized, and then the paints are used to fabricate photonic crystal patterns (PCPs) by paintbrushes. It is confirmed that the suitable paints can be prepared at 8000 rpm centrifugal speed and 30 min centrifugal time. The prepared paints display bright and iridescent structural colors, which indicates that the dye@P(St–BA–MAA) microspheres of paints undergo a certain degree of self‐assembly during the driving of centrifugal forces. The prepared paints fabricate 3D PCPs with bright and iridescent structural colors within 10–20 s. Moreover, when the diameter of microspheres decreases or the viewing angle increases, the resultant structural colors produce a blue shift according to Bragg's diffraction law.

These polymers were characterized by using Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and the Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) was determined both theoretically from the Fox equation and experimentally by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The tetrahydrofuran (THF) insoluble polymer fraction was used to calculate the gel content, and the soluble part was used to determine the average molecular weight by means of Gas Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The adhesive performance was assessed by measuring tack, peel and shear resistance. The results showed that with the 2-EHA rate, the elastic modulus slightly decreased and the shear yield strength slightly increased. Consequently, the loop tack and peel resistances decreased. This behavior was attributed to the increase of the gel content with the ratio of comonomers studied.

Hence, the global butyl acrylate market has grown in the last years and, accordingly, the development of better alternatives to the conventional process, which involves a multistage procedure and homogeneous catalysis, is increasingly gaining the attention of the scientific community. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art of butyl acrylate production and the main results achieved. Patented processes and process integration strategies studied so far are addressed as well as a brief review on the key economic indicators of each process scaled up at industrial scale suggested in the literature. Currently, process integration based strategies with focus on reactive distillation technology and chromatographic reactors (process intensification methods) have been pointed out as alternative routes for the continuous production of butyl acrylate. In summary, from the industrial point of view, Simulated Moving Bed Reactors based processes seem to be one of the most attractive due to its key economic indicators, presenting an economic potential of 30,500 €/y, which is approximately three times higher than the remaining studied processes.",

In this study, a highly flexible shielding film was fabricated using poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate) (p(St-co-BA)) latex as a matrix and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a conductive filler, and then the mechanical properties and EMI shielding performance of the film were examined. Styrene and butyl acrylate were copolymerized to lower the high glass transition temperature and increase the ductility of brittle polystyrene. The latex blending technique was used to produce a shielding film in which the aqueous filler dispersion was uniformly dispersed in the emulsion polymerized resin. To determine the phase change in the copolymer matrix with temperature, the storage modulus was measured, and a time–temperature superposition master curve was constructed. The drying temperature of water-based copolymer resin suitable for film fabrication was set based on this curve. The glass transition temperature and flexibility of the blends were determined by evaluating the thermomechanical analysis and tensile tests. The EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of the films was analyzed at frequencies from 50 MHz to 1.5 GHz, covering the VHF and UHF ranges. As the filler content increased, the SE of the blend film increased, but the elongation increased until a certain content and then decreased. The optimal content of PEDOT:PSS that satisfied both the ductility and shielding performance of the film was found to be 10 wt%. In this case, the elongation at break reached 300%, and the SE of a 1.6 mm thick film was about 35 dB.

The prepared latex was coated on glass panels and cured at appropriate temperature. According to diffusion-controlled mechanism, the diffusion coefficient for these films varied with degree of cross-linking of the films.

Meeting these challenges necessitates researchers' dedicated focus on discovering alternative solutions and advancing the creation of a sustainable ecosystem.This research seeks to tackle these issues by creating homopolymers of castor oil (CO) and copolymers using Castor oil  and n-butyl acrylate, without solvent. The process uses benzoyl peroxide (BZP) as the initiator for polymerization, and the resulting polymers are tested for their effectiveness as additives in lubricating oils. Analyzing the synthesized polymers entails utilizing spectroscopic methods like FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy for characterization purposes. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) is employed to evaluate thermal stability, while gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is utilized to ascertain molecular weight. The effectiveness of additives in enhancing viscosity index (VI) and reducing pour point (PP) is being examined through the ASTM procedure using the SN150 mineral oil standard. The disk diffusion method was utilized to evaluate the biodegradability of various polymers. The results from the experiment and the analysis of the data suggest that the copolymer shows potential as a versatile lubricating oil additive when compared to the homopolymer. Furthermore, elevating the concentration of n-butyl acrylate within the copolymer leads to heightened average molecular weight, better thermal stability, and superior effectiveness as a viscosity index improver (VII) and pour point depressant (PPD). This implies that modifying the copolymer's makeup can enhance its molecular properties and effectiveness when used as an additive in lubricating oil.",

Here, we demonstrate that solvent-free repeatable molecular architectural transformation between liquid-star and nonliquid-network polymers that relies on cleavage and reformation of a covalent bond in hexaarylbiimidazole. Liquid four-armed star-shaped poly(n-butyl acrylate) and poly(dimethyl siloxane) with 2,4,5-triphenylimidazole end groups were first synthesized. Subsequent oxidation of the 2,4,5-triphenylimidazoles into 2,4,5-triphenylimidazoryl radicals and their coupling with these liquid star polymers to form hexaarylbiimidazoles afforded the corresponding nonliquid network polymers. The resulting nonliquid network polymers liquefied upon UV irradiation and produced liquid star-shaped polymers with 2,4,5-triphenylimidazoryl radical end groups that reverted to nonliquid network polymers again by recoupling of the generated 2,4,5-triphenylimidazoryl radicals immediately after terminating UV irradiation. The design of organic and polymeric soft materials showing isothermal reversible liquid–nonliquid conversion is challenging.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Despite many efforts devoted toward the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at the framework level by selecting the building blocks, their organization in the nano to meso regimes is often neglected. Moreover, the importance of processability for their applications has recently emerged and the synthesis of COF nanostructures without agglomeration is still a challenge. Herein, the first example of hybrid COF-polymer particles for which polymers are used to manipulate the 2D COF growth along a specific direction is reported. The study examines how the nature, chain-end functionality, and molar mass of the polymer influence the shaping of hybrid 2D boronate ester-linked COF-polymer particles. Catechol-poly(N-butyl acrylate) leads to the self-assembly of crystallites into quasi-spherical structures while catechol-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) mediates the synthesis of raspberry-like COF-polymer particles with radial grain orientation. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM) and 4D-STEM-ACOM (automated crystal orientation mapping) highlight the single-crystal character of these domains with one plane family throughout the particles. Interestingly, the presence of PNIPAm on the particle surface allows their drying without co-crystallization and enables their resuspension. Kinetic investigations show that catechol-PnBuA acts as a modulator and catechol-PNIPAm induces a template effect, introducing supramolecular self-assembly properties into particles to create new morphologies with higher structural complexity, beyond the framework level.",

This polyacrylic showed good film properties; high transparency, water resistance and mechanical flexibility that may suitable for many environmental based applications such as coating, packaging, label sensors etc. In order to access the photo-stability of this material for environmental application, studies were conducted under UV illumination of a short-wavelength (λ = 254 nm) in air. The responses were collected at different irradiation times by using several characterization techniques: infrared/UV-visible spectroscopy (FTIR/UV-Vis), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Two distinguishable structures, cross-linked and fragmented chains, were formed under photo-irradiation at different times of exposure. The formation of cross-linked structures at short irradiation times (t 60 min) causes the copolymer to degrade. The centre of reaction was identified at the pendent group and no effect of main chain destabilization was observed throughout the experimental condition. The occurrence of chain cleavage during photo-degradation causes chain–chain separation, as visually seen under the imaging technique and this coincides with the observed drop in thermal stability.

Finally, the hydrophobic droplets are photopolymerized via a UV light source as they traverse the microfluidic channel to produce the cationic amphiphilic microgels. This platform enables the rapid, automated, and in situ production of amphiphilic microgels, which do not match the core‐shell structure of conventionally prepared microgels but are instead based on random amphiphilic copolymers of DMAEMA and BuA between the hydrophobic cross‐links.

The two polymers feature different non‐covalent binding motifs, which form dynamic, reversible cross‐links. The polymers were prepared by reversible addition−fragmentation chain‐transfer polymerization of n‐butyl acrylate and either the self‐complementary hydrogen‐bonding motif 2‐ureido‐4[1H]pyrimidinone, or the 2,6‐bis(1′‐methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine ligand, which forms complexes with metal ions. The supramolecular DN made by these components combines features of the single networks, including high thermal stability and resistance to creep. The DN further exhibits excellent healability and displays a higher extensibility and a higher toughness than its constituents. The mechanical characteristics of the DN can be further enhanced by selectively pre‐stretching one of the networks, which is readily possible due to the reversible formation of the supramolecular cross‐links and their orthogonal stimuli‐responsiveness.",

The effect of the AC/PU weight ratio and the acrylate type including methyl methacrylate (MMA), butyl acrylate (BA) and mixture of them on the properties of the synthesized emulsions and resultant films were investigated. The research results showed that the colloidal particle of the emulsions behaved core‐shell structure, and the copolymers were not crosslinked. An increase in the AC/PU weight ratio led to an increase in the average particles size and the particle size distribution, but decrease in the viscosity of the emulsions. Meanwhile, the molecular weight distribution of the copolymers became wide, and the tensile stress, shore A hardness, storage modulus, glass transfer temperature, water resistance, and water contact angle of the resultant films increased, except that the films of PU‐BA were too soft to determine their mechanical properties. MMA and BA can provide the PU‐AC hybrid emulsions with very different properties, and which can be adjusted according to the special application. It was suggested that APEE can not only built up chemical bonds between PU and AC, but also increase the self‐emulsifying ability in the emulsion polymerization due to its hydrophilic ethylene oxide and carboxylic groups, resulting in that PU‐AC hybrid emulsions with high AC/PU ratio can be obtained by this method. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The synthesis was carried out in methyl ethyl ketone by benzoyl peroxide as the initiator at 70 °C. Secondly, the MA-BA copolymer was chemically modified with ethylenediamine and abbreviated as NH2MA-BA. The copolymer and its modified structure were analyzed spectroscopically by FT-IR, thermally by Thermo Gravimetry (TGA) and by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Solubility tests of both structures were performed. Then, the adsorption of cadmium ions (Cd2+) by the modified copolymer (NH2MA-BA) was studied.\n                  The copolymer and its modified structure were synthesized successfully, and this was proven by their FTIR spectra. The (MA-BA) copolymer is soluble in common organic solvents but (NH2MA-BA) is not due to cross-linking. The DSC and DTA results showed that chemical modification improved the structure thermally. It was shown that the Freundlich model was the best explanation for the adsorption type in correspondence with the experimental plots, and the modified copolymer is a good candidate for Cd2+ adsorption.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of intramolecular transfer to polymer in the radical polymerization of acrylic monomers has been extensively documented in the literature. Whilst it has been largely assumed that intramolecular transfer to polymer leads to short chain branches, there has been some speculation over whether the mid-chain radical can migrate. Herein, by the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of poly(n-butyl acrylate) synthesized by solution polymerization under a range of conditions, it is shown that this mid-chain radical migration does occur in the radical polymerization of acrylates conducted at high temperatures, as is evident from the shape of the molecular weight distribution. Using a mathematical model, an initial approximation of the rate at which migration occurs is made and the distribution of branching lengths formed in this scenario is explored. It is shown that the polymerizations carried out under a low monomer concentration and at high temperatures are particularly prone to radical migration reactions, which may affect the rheological properties of the polymer.",

We show that the latex/CNC interaction is me-diated by electrostatics, the interaction being the strongest with the most charged particles. The adsorption process is efficient and does not require any functionalization step for either cellulose or latex. A major result is the observation by cryogenic transmission electron micros-copy of latexes coated with entangled arrays of CNCs, and for the softer particles a notable deformation of their structure into faceted polyhedra. By labeling the latexes with hydrophobic carbocyanine dyes, their deposition on woven cotton fabrics is studied in situ and quantified by fluorescence microscopy. As with the CNCs, the highest deposition on cotton in the wet and dried states is achieved with the most charged latexes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Commercial adhesives typically fall into two categories: structural or pressure sensitive. Structural glues rely on covalent bonds formed during curing and provide high tensile strength whilst pressure‐sensitive adhesives use physical bonding to provide weaker adhesion, but with considerable convenience for the user. Here, a new class of adhesive is presented that is also reversible, with a bond strength intermediate between those of pressure‐sensitive and structural adhesives. Complementary water‐based formulations incorporating oppositely charged polyelectrolytes form electrostatic bonds that may be reversed through immersion in a low or high pH aqueous environment. This electrostatic adhesive has the advantageous property that it exhibits good adhesion to low‐energy surfaces such as polypropylene. Furthermore, it is produced by the emulsion copolymerization of commodity materials, styrene and butyl acrylate, which makes it inexpensive and opens the possibility of industrial production. Bio‐based materials have been also integrated into the formulations to further increase sustainability. Moreover, unlike other water‐based glues, adhesion does not significantly degrade in humid environments. Because such electrostatic adhesives do not require mechanical detachment, they are appropriate for the large‐scale recycling of, e.g., bottle labels or food packaging. The adhesive is also suitable for dismantling components in areas as varied as automotive parts and electronics.",

The composites were prepared by two‐step extrusion, and tensile and Izod impact tests were conducted. The optimized formulation, using maleic anhydride‐grafted ethylene‐butyl acrylate (EBA‐g‐MA) with MB processing, increased impact strength by 50.5% (86.45 J/m) and elongation at break by 243.6% (13.71%) compared with the unmodified wood flour/ASA composite, while maintaining tensile strength.

These presynthesized cross-linked BCPs (PBA n-Tri m) were, for the first time, revealed to exhibit many advantages in serving as the electron-extraction layer (EEL) for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The cross-linked BCPs possessed intense ionic functionality, showing well capability to form effective interfacial dipoles at the indium tin oxide interface to facilitate the charge extraction at the corresponding interface.

Methacrylate‐functionalized zirconium oxoclusters Zr4O2(OMc)12 and [Zr6O4(OH)4(OOCCH2CH3)3{OOCC(CH3)=CH2}9]2, with the covalent incorporation in a butyl acrylate (BA)/polycaprolactone dimethacrylate (PCLDMA) copolymer and the noncovalent incorporation of [Zr6O4(OH)4(OOCCH2CH3)12]2 are focused upon herein. Shape recovery and fixity rates are studied to observe if the shape memory properties are preserved upon going from a simple copolymer to noncovalent or covalent‐based hybrids. These rates display values higher than 90 %, which provides evidence that the oxocluster does not hinder the shape memory properties in the hybrid materials. The introduction of an inorganic phase and the progressively more stable interactions between organic and inorganic parts lead to an enhancement of the thermomechanical properties. The materials are characterized through FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and swelling tests. Dynamic–mechanical analyses are used to investigate whether the hybrid materials display thermally activated shape memory properties. The stability of the hybrid materials are evaluated by a combined spectroscopic approach based on FTIR, solid‐state NMR, and X‐ray absorption spectroscopy.",

Monobutyl itaconate (MBI), an unsaturated carboxylic acid, its application as functional monomer in emulsion polymerization at low concentration could effectively improve the thermal stability of emulsion and the adhesion of various matrixes, and allow the introduction of reactive groups on the surface of particles after modification. The purpose of this paper is that MBI is used to modify the latex. MBI can produce a cross-linked network structure with acrylate, which can be formed by the hydrolysis in this system. The water molecules cannot permeate into the cross-linked network when the amount of MBI is moderate.\n \n \n \n The MBI modified cationic acrylate latex was successfully prepared via the semi-continuous emulsion polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and MBI in water phase, which were initiated with water soluble azo initiator and emulsified with the mixed surfactants of dodecyl amine ethoxylates quaternary (DAEQ) and alkyl polyglucosides (APG). The films of the resultant latex were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and contact angle (CA) determinator, respectively.\n \n \n \n The conditions of preparing the modified latexes were optimized and obtained as follows: the amount of emulsifiers and the initiator are 6.0% (Wt.%) and 0.6% (Wt.%), respectively; the mass ratio of DAEQ to APG is 3:1; the amount of MBI is 4.0% (Wt.%). In this case, the conversion percentage is high and the polymerization stability is good. In comparison with the conventional cationic acrylate latex, the water resistance of modified latex films is improved.\n \n \n \n Preparation of the MBI modified cationic acrylate latex is seldom reported. In this study, The MBI modified cationic acrylate latex was successfully prepared via the semi-continuous emulsion polymerization of BA, MMA and MBI in water phase, which were initiated with water soluble azo initiator and emulsified with the mixed surfactants of DAEQ and APG.\n",

    "abstract": "Bottlebrush random copolymers (BRCPs), consisting of a random distribution of two homopolymer chains along a backbone, can segregate to the interface between two immiscible homopolymers. BRCPs undergo a reconfiguration, where each block segregates to one of the homopolymer phases, adopting a Janus-type structure, reducing the interfacial tension and promoting adhesion between the two homopolymers, thereby serving as a Janus bottlebrush copolymer (JBCP) compatibilizer. We synthesized a series of JBCPs by copolymerizing deuterated or hydrogenated polystyrene (DPS/PS) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) macromonomers using ruthenium benzylidene-initiated ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Subsequent acid-catalyzed hydrolysis converted the PtBA brushes to poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The JBCPs were then placed at the interface between DPS/PS homopolymers and poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP) homopolymers, where the degree of polymerization of the backbone (NBB) and the grafting density (GD) of the JBCPs were varied. Neutron reflectivity (NR) was used to determine the interfacial width and segmental density distributions (including PS homopolymer, PS block, PAA block and P2VP homopolymer) across the polymer-polymer interface. Our findings indicate that the star-like JBCP with NBB = 6 produces the largest interfacial broadening. Increasing NBB to 100 (rod-like shape) and 250 (worm-like shape) reduced the interfacial broadening due to a decrease in the interactions between blocks and homopolymers by stretching of blocks. Decreasing the GD from 100% to 80% at NBB = 100 caused an increase the interfacial width, yet further decreasing the GD to 50% and 20% reduced the interfacial width, as 80% of GD may efficiently increase the flexibility of blocks and promote interactions between homopolymers, while maintaining relatively high number of blocks attached to one molecule. The interfacial conformation of JBCPs was further translated into compatibilization efficiency. Thin film morphology studies showed that only the lower NBB values (NBB = 6 and NBB = 24) and the 80% GD of NBB = 100 had bicontinuous morphologies, due to a sufficient binding energy that arrested phase separation, supported by mechanical testing using asymmetric double cantilever beam (ADCB) tests. These provide fundamental insights into the assembly behavior of JBCPs compatibilizers at homopolymer interfaces, opening strategies for the design of new BCP compatibilizers.",

Analysis of a range of poly(acrylate) homopolymers by LID have found slight improvement over CID, with less rearrangements in the poly(butyl acrylate) fragmentation and more backbone cleavages. Analysis of both block and statistical copolymers, when compared to homopolymer analogues, yield markedly different spectra which can be correlated to give some monomer sequence information, thus achieving a wealth of structural information from two samples which would otherwise be identical by single stage MALDI-ToF analysis.

    "abstract": "Lead halide perovskite has currently emerged as a research hotspot in the field of photocatalysis due to its exceptional photovoltaic characteristics. Despite its potential, the susceptibility to degradation under harsh conditions such as light, humidity, and polar solvents poses a significant challenge. To counteract this, a strategy employing silica to shield the perovskite surface is conducted, thereby enhancing its stability. The resulting composite MAPbBr3@SiO2 is then deployed as a photocatalyst in the photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET‐RAFT) polymerization of butyl acrylate within polar solvents. The catalytic performance across different RAFT polymerization systems including varying the RAFT reagents, catalyst concentrations, and solvent types is meticulously examined. Remarkably, with a photocatalyst loading of merely 0.004 wt% and under a blue light intensity of 6 mW/cm2, over 80% monomer conversion can be achieved in 4 h. Moreover, the molecular weight distribution (Đ) consistently remains within the narrow range of 1.0–1.2 across all experimental setups, which proves the controllable nature of the PET‐RAFT process. Owning the advantages of low photocatalyst requirement, compatibility with polar solvents, and narrow molecular weight distribution, PET‐RAFT polymerization mediated by MAPbBr3@SiO2 holds promise for scalable manufacturing and industrial‐scale applications.",

The pH transducer was made from non-plasticized polyacrylate membrane containing a hydrogen ionophore and lipophilic salt. The immobilized CES enzyme catalyzed the enzymatic hydrolysis of aspartame to L-aspartic acid (L-Asp), L-phenylalanine and methanol. Potentiometric determination of aspartame concentration was performed by quantifying the hydrogen ion concentration produced from L-Asp. The potentiometric determination of aspartame exhibited good selectivity with near Nernstian response. The sensitivity of the biosensor was closed to the Nernstian value, i.e., 50-52 mV decade-1 with a dynamic linear response range from 10-5 to 10-2 M and detection limit approaching 10-6 M. The aspartame biosensor demonstrated good repeatability and reproducibility with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively (n=3).

    "abstract": "Gels with multiple stimuli-responsive actuating behaviour have shown great potential in many applications. Nevertheless, facile approaches to rapidly preparing gel actuators are still highly needed, and obtaining gels possessing both actuating and auto-healing capabilities remains a challenge. Herein, we report the rapid preparation of gel actuators with a self-healing ability. Dual-component gels, composed of poly(BA-co-VI-co-AM) (G-1) and poly(BA-co-AA-co-AM/β-CD) (G-2) (BA = butyl acrylate, VI = N-vinyl imidazole, AM = acrylamide, AA = acrylic acid, β-CD = β-cyclodextrin), are prepared within 10 minutes (min) via biphase frontal polymerization (FP). Both G-1 and G-2 gels show excellent intrinsic self-healing properties based on hydrogen bonds, with healing efficiencies of 91% and 97%, respectively; self-healing between G-1 and G-2 also occurs due to hydrogen bonding and host-guest interactions. Moreover, dual-component gels, in terms of G-1 and G-2 bilayer gel flowers and strips, heterogeneous healed bilayer gel strips, and microfluidic-directed bilayer gel microsphere ensembles, all show actuating behaviour in acidic, alkaline and organic solutions, with actuation degrees up to 96% in 5 min. The actuation mechanism is also proposed. This work might provide new insights into fast synthesis of self-healing dual-component gels towards application in the actuator field.",

The chemically crosslinked polyionic liquid gel electrolyte (PIL) is prepared using 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) monomer and a polymerisable ionic liquid, 1,4-di(vinylimidazolium)butane bisbromide (DVIMBr) in an ionic liquid (IL- 1-butyl-3 methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate) as the polymerisation solvent, which resulted in in-situ entrapment of the IL in the gel during polymerisation and crosslinking of the polymer. The supported liquid gel electrolyte (SLG) material was characterised with thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and dynamic mechanical analysis, and was found to be stable with good mechanical properties.

To enhance the collection of chalcopyrite in the presence of serpentine, novel nanospheres of poly styrene-butyl acrylate (St-Ba) were prepared and used as collector to improve the floatability of the chalcopyrite minerals. The micro-flotation tests showed that the St-Ba nanospheres could well eliminate the inhibition of serpentine on the chalcopyrite and greatly increase the chalcopyrite recovery. Compared with SBX, the St-Ba nanospheres enhanced the floatation recovery from 89% to 95% for the single chalcopyrite mineral, and from 42% to 84% for the mixed ores of chalcopyrite and serpentine. Adsorption tests, contact angle measurement, SEM observation and Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed that the St-Ba nanospheres could be firmly adsorbed on the surface of chalcopyrite, which could not only increase the mineral hydrophobicity, but also act as a bridge between chalcopyrite particles and air bubbles to enhance the floatability of the chalcopyrite. The results of this work indicated that the organic nanospheres was an effective novel collector and could be used to solve the inhibitory effect of gangue mineral fines on target mineral flotation.",

This feature is achieved through specific interactions in the active site during catalytic turnover and is not just facilitated by two catalytically active amino acids. Intrigued by these features, a biomimetic α-galactosidase mimic was developed using an empirical catalyst design. Starting with a library of 704 gels of which 250 have a unique composition synthesized from TEGDMA cross-linker and 7 selected monomers, 238 monomodal gels are evaluated for their ability to hydrolyze the 1→6 α-glycosidic bond in the disaccharide melibiose. Among those, 13 polyacrylate gels with the potential for high catalytic activity are identified using spectrophotometric screening assays based on Schiff bases formed with toluidine. The best-performing polyacrylate (gel A) was found to have a 1500-fold higher proficiency to hydrolyze the 1→6 α-glycosidic bond in melibiose over the 1→2 α-glycosidic bond in sucrose, translating to selective hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages in the trisaccharide raffinose. The matrix of gel A is composed of 25 mol % TEGDMA cross-linker and equimolar amounts of cyclohexyl, butyl, and benzyl acrylate accounting for CH-π and hydrophobic interaction in the surrounding of a hydrolytic binuclear Cu(II) complex.

    "abstract": "Heavy metals are not biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms. Many heavy metal ions are known to be toxic or carcinogenic. Thus, removal of these toxic heavy metals from water is of crucial importance to protect the human population and the environment. In recent years, polymeric adsorbents have received considerable interest for heavy metal removal mainly due to important technological and scientific developments such as easy synthesis at controlled dimensions with variable functional groups, perfect mechanical rigidity, tunable surface chemistry, large surface area, pore size distribution, high uptake values and feasible regeneration under mild conditions. This chapter has attempted to present to the readers the widespread investigations of acrylic-based polymeric adsorbents so that the reader can get an idea about the various types and forms of polymeric materials used for the removal of heavy metals from water. grafting of AA onto the chitosan beads was performed using 60 Co gamma-source. The grafting rate of 81% was obtained at a dose rate of 20.64 Gy min −1 . The FTIR was used for the structural characterisation of the sor-bent, and their swelling measurements were performed at different pH values. The adsorp tion experiments were carried out both with modified and unmodified chitosan beads for Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions, and it was found that the grafting of new groups increased the number of adsorption sites in chitosan, leading to the increase in adsorption capacity. The optimum pH for Cd(II) and Pb(II) uptake was between 4 and 7 using the synthesised adsorbent. The experimental kinetic data were found to have a better fit with pseudo-second-order reaction, and Langmuir isotherm model was found to be more suitable to represent the experimental equilibrium. complex between the groups and Pb(II) ions. The kinetics and thermodynamics of Pb(II) onto and PAAc-Bent the Batch-type adsorption experiments conducted at different times, Pb(II) concentrations and temperatures. A fast adsorption (≥99.4% adsorption in 30 min) was observed at low lead concentration due to high complex ation affinity between metal ions and reactive functional groups on the surface of PAA-Bent. At higher lead concentrations, more Pb(II) ions were left unabsorbed in solution due to the saturation of binding sites so that the equilibrium time for Pb(II) adsorption by the PAA-Bent nanocomposite increased from ~30 to ~60 min. When the effect of temperature was examined, the adsorption of lead ions increased with increasing temperature both for Bent and PAA-Bent. The equilibrium studies showed that Pb(II) adsorption data on PAA-Bent followed the Langmuir model. The endothermic and spontaneous adsorption of Pb(II) ions for both Bent and PAA-Bent adsorbents was evaluated using thermodynamic studies. The adsorption kinetics of Pb onto PAA-Bent fitted better with the pseudo-second-order and pseudo-first-order kinetic mod els better than the Elovich and intraparticle diffusion models suggesting that chemi-adsorption controls the adsorption process. These results have indicated that PAA-Bent nanocomposite could be efficiently used as an adsorbent in lead removal studies from waste water. morphology of PAA-K hydrogel was evaluated using FTIR and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The particle size of kaolin clay was measured from the TEM images and found to be in the range of 20–50 nm. The hydro gels were prepared using ultrasound-induced polymerisation and conventional process. The effect of different parameters (pH, temperature, initial dye concentration, quantity of hydrogel and clay content) on the extent of adsorption was examined in batch mode for the hydrogels that were prepared both by using ultrasound-induced polymerisation and conventional process. The concentration of BG dye was measured using UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 624 nm. Better results were obtained for the hydrogel prepared by ultrasound-assisted polymerisa tion process. The removal of BG dye was found to increase with an increase in pH (till the optimum value of 7), temperature, adsorbent and adsorbate concentrations as well as the kaolin clay content in the hydrogel. It has been observed that the maximum BG dye removal by PAA-K hydrogel was achieved for the initial dye concentration of 30 mg L −1 at a temperature of 35°C and pH 7. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to fit the kinetic data. Both Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherm models explained the experimental results satisfactorily. Moreover, the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The removal of Co(II) from the aqueous solutions was investigated using PAA-grafted multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) Plasma techniques were applied to graft PAA onto the surface of MWCNTs improve their dispersion property and adsorption in the aqueous The raw MWCNT MWCNT-g-PAA such FTIR, TGA, Raman spectroscopy, SEM and TEM. The microstructures of the raw MWCNTs MWCNT-g-PAAc observed SEM and curled for of almost no differences in their surface. A more compact stacking morphology observed for MWCNT-g-PAA due to the interactions of carboxylic acid groups on the surface of MWCNTs. A very thin layer of grafted PAA was coated on partial external walls of MWCNTs and was investigated with TEM images. The results of FTIR spectra of raw MWCNTs and MWCNT-g-PAA were compared, and MWCNT-g-PAA exhibited a relatively stronger broad peak around 3400 cm −1 due to the O–H stretching vibration, which suggests the existence of hydroxyl, the functional group from PAA and chemisorbed water. Moreover, peaks at 3430 cm −1 ( ─ OH), 1680 cm −1 (C ═ O), 700 cm −1 ( ─ CH 2 ─ ) and 1080 and 1200 cm −1 (C ─ O) suggest that PAA was successfully grafted on the surface of raw MWCNTs by the plasma-induced grafting method. The TGA curves have indicated that the carbon impurity (such as amorphous carbon) in MWCNTs used was negligible, and the weight percentage of grafted PAA on the surface of MWCNTs was estimated to be 4.4%. The adsorption capacity of both adsorbents towards Co(II) ions was investigated, and the adsorption parameters (shaking time, pH, ionic strength and temperature) were optimised. A pH-dependent and rapid adsorption was observed. The main adsorption mechanism for Co(II) adsorbed onto MWCNT-g-PAA was stated to be due to the complexation of Co(II) with carboxyl groups on the surface of MWCNT-g-PAA. The spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process was well described by the pseudo-second-order model. As a result, PAA was successfully grafted on the surface of raw MWCNTs and obviously enhanced its adsorption capacity for Co(II) enables MWCNT-g-PAA as a promising adsorbent in water purification Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions in aqueous solution. The FTIR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), SEM-EDX and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to elucidate the adsorption mechanism before and after interaction of PGME-10/12-DETA with the target ions. The XPS and FTIR analyses suggest that complexation through the formation of metal–O and metal–N bonds with the -OH, -NH and -NH 2 groups as the possible mechanism of Cu(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II) adsorption on sample PGME-10/12-DETA. The AFM images indicate that the metal adsorption induces change in the size and morphology of the amino-functionalised PGME. The time required to reach 50% of the total adsorption capacity was 5 min for all the investigated metal ions. Already after 30 min, PGME-10/12-DETA attained approximately 90%, and after 180 min, 95% of metal ions with maximal capacity was adsorbed. The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and surface reaction-based kinetic models were fitted to the experimental data, and the pseudo-second-order model was found to describe adsorption kinetics for all metal ions. A magnetic glycidyl methacrylate resin was synthesised by Elwakeel for the removal of Hg(II) in industrial waste water. The adsorbent was synthesised by coating a magnetite core with glycidyl methacrylate–based polymer. Further, it was grafted with diethylene tri amine (DETA). The characterisation methods (SEM, SEM-EDX, FTIR, BET and TEM) used indicated the successful synthesis of the polymer. The absence of coercivity and remanence in vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) analysis confirmed that the material has super para magnetic properties. The effects of pH, counter ions, adsorbent amount and the tempera ture were investigated. Moreover, reaction kinetics and adsorption isotherms were studied. maximum adsorption capacity was obtained at a pH of ~4. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were best fitted with the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir equation, respectively. Thermodynamic studies indicated that adsorption of Hg(II) by the adsorbent is exothermic and spontaneous with increased randomness. The desorption from the adsorbent was realised with KI or KI-thiourea mixture, and at least four cycles of adsorption/desorp-tion were obtained with the proposed adsorbent. Two industrial effluents were used for the removal of Hg(II), and satisfactory results were obtained. The surface characterisations of the adsorbent and the mechanism of the adsorption process were achieved using techniques, namely, FTIR, XRD and SEM/EDS. Moreover, XPS spectra of the n-butyl acrylate-grafted chitosan before and after adsorption with Cr(VI) were assessed. It was evaluated that the adsorption mechanism involved the electrostatic interaction between hydrochromate anion and the amino hydroxyl groups of the adsorbent. An effective adsorption was achieved at a pH of 3.5 with 25 mL of 20 mg L −1 Cr(VI) solution. The Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Temkin, Elovich and Redlich isotherms were studied in detail. A Langmuir adsorption capacity of 17.15 mg g −1 was attained, and the negative entropy change obtained in the study was due to the decrease in randomness at adsorbent-solution interface.

Poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) latex particles (LPs) were employed as hydrophobic association cross-linking centers. First, the PBA latex particles were prepared via emulsion polymerization, and then, LP-Gel with high mechanical strength was prepared via one-pot free radical polymerization using acrylamide as a monomer, LP as a cross-linking center, and methacrylate as a hydrophobic molecule. It was found that the length of the hydrophobic alkyl chains from methacrylate has a significant effect on the mechanical performance and swelling degree of the hydrogels. The short alkyl chains exhibited weak hydrophobic interactions, and the resulting LP-Gel had a low mechanical strength. However, the long alkyl chains can effectively entangle with LPs through strong hydrophobic interactions, which significantly enhance the mechanical strength of the hydrogels. As a result, the LP-Gel exhibits a maximum fracture stress of 1.2 MPa and elongation of 2336%.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Polymeric materials are widely used in medical devices, where their interactions with proteins play a critical role in determining biocompatibility. To better understand and predict these interactions, we extend the coarse-grained force field (FF), SPICA, to simulate protein adsorption on poly(ω-methoxyalkyl acrylate) (PMCxA) and poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) surfaces. Notably, poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA), a member of PMCxA family, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical applications. Our polymer FF was parametrized using the physical properties─density, interfacial tension, and hydration free energy─of small-molecule analogs representing the monomer units. Protein-polymer interactions were further calibrated using adsorption free energies of amino acid side-chain analogs on polymer-based monolayers. The developed SPICA-FF accurately reproduces both bulk polymer properties and protein adsorption behaviors in agreement with experimental and atomistic simulation data. Our simulations show that PBA strongly attracts water-soluble globular proteins, while PMEA resists adsorption when proteins retain their native structures. For PMCxA variants, protein adsorption correlates linearly with both surface water contact angle and the free energy of cavity formation at the interface, highlighting surface hydrophobicity─particularly the number of methylene units in the polymer side chains─as a key determinant. This work offers a validated framework for studying protein-polymer interactions at a coarse-grained level, enabling more efficient screening and design of polymer surfaces for medical applications. It highlights the significance of polymer surface chemistry in determining protein behavior, offering valuable insights for the rational design of biocompatible materials.",

The cooling features were characterized via ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV–vis–NIR) spectrophotometry and heat build‐up tests. FTIR spectra show the disappearance of the vinylic absorption peak at 1636 cm−1 of the modified TiO2 which signifies good chemical interaction between the poly (butyl acrylate) chains and the nanoparticles. DLS measurements revealed relative enlargement in the diameter of nanocomposite latex particles from 107 to 184 nm as the percentage of mineral nanoparticles increased. SEM and TEM analysis revealed the formation of a core‐shell morphology with an almost uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the polymer chains. Spectral properties details obtained using UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometry revealed that surface modification of TiO2 nanoparticles resulted in a more than 7% increase in solar transmittance compared to the raw form. Nevertheless, grafting a thermoplastic shell onto the acrylic core reduced the average solar transmittance from 81.92% to 55.32%.

Measuring performance parameters of the resulting PSAs showed that increasing the relative amount of BA led to a decrease in the tack strength but an increase in the peel strength. In addition, the resistance of the PSAs to heat and humidity increased with increasing BA concentration. This result was correlated with the rheological and thermal properties of the PSA polymer.

FTIR analyses evidenced the occurrence of reactive compatibilization of E‐GMA and EBA‐MAH with PLA in the binary blends due to the reactivity of the GMA and MAH functional groups with the terminal hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of PLA. Rheological measurements evidenced the occurrence of cross‐link reactions between E‐GMA and EBA‐MAH copolymers in the ternary blend. Three distinct morphologies were observed in the blends: PLA/E‐GMA exhibited a sea‐island structure, PLA/EBA‐MAH exhibited a co‐continuous structure, and PLA/E‐GMA/EBA‐MAH exhibited a semi‐interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN) structure. The shape memory effect (SME) of PLA and PLA/copolymers blends was evaluated by three different methods: fold‐deploy, tension, and torsion.

    "abstract": "In\nthe present work, the photocatalytic activity was investigated\ntoward a thiol-Michael reaction of different combinations of 9-fluorenylmethyl\ncarbamate (Fmoc) derivatives and photocaged amines (PCA) as base amplifiers\nand the catalytic base, respectively. This phototriggering approach\nwas systematically studied for evaluating its effect on kinetics between\nthiol and Michael acceptors like acrylate or sulfone wherein, butyl\n3-mercaptopropionate (BMP), 1-hexyl acrylate (HA), and ethyl vinyl\nsulfone (EVS) were used as model reactants. Interestingly, PCAs exhibited\nlow quantum yields by themselves; NPPOC-Hex (2.5 mol %) which when\nused with BMP and HA, resulted in only 25% thiol conversion; however,\nwhen used along with Fmoc-Hex or Fmoc-TMG (2.5 or 5 mol %), it resulted\nin a higher thiol conversion of 50–60%. Furthermore, use of\nNPPOC-DEA (5 mol %) with 1 mol % Fmoc-TMG resulted in >70% thiol\nconversion\nfor the same system. Upon using BMP and EVS nearly complete conversion\nof functional groups with 5 mol % NPPOC-DEA and 5 mol % Fmoc-DEA was\nobtained. This enhancement in reaction kinetics and conversion upon\naddition of an Fmoc derivative to a monofunctional thiol-Michael system\nwas extended to multifunctional derivatives for polymerizing cross-linked\npolymer networks. Moreover, the kinetic study on model reactants also\ndemonstrated efficient dark curing, resulting in 50–75% thiol\nconversion with only 30 s irradiation time, leading to validation\nof the efficacy of Fmoc derivatives and PCAs as photocatalysts for\ndark cure. Upon precise characterization in cross-linked systems using\nRaman spectroscopy for TMPTA/PETMP in the presence of 20 mol % NPPOC-DEA\nand 1 mol % Fmoc-TMG, the extent of dark cure was evaluated for a\ndistance of 16.5 mm, which was observed to undergo maximum conversion\nand high dark cure propagation upon heating to 70 °C. Therefore,\nFmoc-PCA catalysis is a practically useful approach for improving\nthe photoinitiated efficiency of the thiol-Michael reaction and enabling\nphotopolymerization in the dark with a marked improvement in photosensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Heterografted molecular bottlebrushes (MBBs) with side chains composed of poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) and pH-responsive poly(2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA, pKa = 7.4) have been shown to be efficient, robust, and responsive emulsifiers. However, it remains unknown how they respond to external stimuli at interfaces. In this work, the shape-changing behavior of six hetero- and homografted MBBs at air-water interfaces in response to pH changes and lateral compression was investigated using a Langmuir-Blodgett trough and atomic force microscopy. At a surface pressure of 0.5 mN m-1, PDEAEMA-containing MBBs showed no worm-globule transitions when the pH was increased from 4.0 to 10.0, at which PDEAEMA becomes insoluble in water. Upon lateral compression at pH 4.0, MBBs with a mole fraction of PDEAEMA side chains (xPDEAEMA) < 0.50 underwent pronounced worm-globule shape transitions; there was an increasing tendency for bottlebrushes to become connected with increasing xPDEAEMA. At xPDEAEMA = 0.76, the molecules remained wormlike even at high compression. These observations were presumably caused by the increased electrostatic repulsion between protonated PDEAEMA side chains in the subphase with increasing xPDEAEMA, hindering the shape change. At pH 10.0, MBBs with xPDEAEMA < 0.50 showed a lower tendency to change their wormlike morphologies upon compression than at pH 4.0. No shape transition was observed when xPDEAEMA > 0.50, attributed to the relatively high affinity toward water and the rigidity of PDEAEMA. This study revealed the shape-changing behavior of amphiphilic pH-responsive MBBs at air-water interfaces, which could be useful for future design of multicomponent MBBs for potential applications.",

During the UV-curing process, the synthesized isosorbide diacrylate ester (IDAE) served as the crosslinker, effectively improving the crosslinking degree of PSA. The impact of IA and IDAE on the mechanical properties of PSA was studied. Moreover, to achieve a balance between adhesion and cohesion, the optimal composition was identified. The addition of IA significantly enhances the stiffness of PSA. Furthermore, the combined effect of IA and IDAE improves the overall adhesion properties of the PSA.

    "abstract": "Silica-based nanoparticles (SNPs) are highly regarded as advantageous nanofillers for composite coating, owing to their high surface area, robust mechanical properties, chemical stability, and adaptability for surface modification. Recent studies have unveiled the potential photoluminescence of SNPs induced by intrinsic defect sites, eliminating the need for additional fluorescein molecules. However, the inadequate quantum yield and complex preparation processes for generating defect sites within SNPs have constrained their broader applications. Herein, we propose a facile method to prepare Janus silicon-based nanoparticles with a hierarchical bowl-shaped structure (JHSNPs) through the emulsification of methyltriethoxysilane hydrolysis and condensation products, coupled with the capillary force during nanoparticle formation. The distinctive structure enhances the formation of dioxasilyrane (=Si(O2)) and silylene (=Si) defects, thereby exhibiting strong blue photoluminescence. The JHSNPs then serve as nanofillers for commonly used poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate) (SA) waterborne coatings, significantly enhancing their mechanical properties, abrasion resistance, and UV radiation resistance compared to the original SA coatings. Moreover, with just a 1 % addition of JHSNPs, the composite coating exhibits visible fluorescence intensity, conferring the self-detecting monitoring properties for external scratches. Due to the hierarchical air-entrapping void structure, JHSNPs composite coatings demonstrate excellent thermal isolation performance, with a 22 % reduction in thermal conductivity. The design of JHSNPs opens new avenues to expand the versatility of silica-based nanoparticles in composite coatings, especially in the optical, safety, and energy-saving fields.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a dominant predatory natural enemy species in cotton-planting, is a key biological control agent for aphids in China. Our previous study showed that herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) from Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Fisch.) (Fabales: Fabaceae) and Alhagi sparsifolia (Desv.) (Fabales: Fabaceae) plants infested with Aphis atrata (Zhang) (Homoptera: Aphididae), were important semiochemicals for H. variegata to locate aphids. However, little was known about the varieties and function of active volatiles from HIPVs of the two plant species.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, results from gas chromatography-electroantennography detection (GC-EAD) demonstrated that seven HIPVs (butyl acrylate, α-pinene, butyl isobutyrate, β-pinene, butyl butyrate, 1,3-diethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene) identified from the two damaged plant species elicited antennal responses from H. variegata. Also, results from gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that the concentrations of the seven active volatiles were significantly higher than those from corresponding healthy plants. Hippodamia variegata exhibited varying degrees of response to each active volatile in EAG trials, however, only α-pinene, butyl isobutyrate, β-pinene and butyl butyrate significantly attracted H. variegata in behavioral trials conducted in the laboratory. They also had a better trapping effect on H. variegata in cotton fields.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFour active compounds (α-pinene, butyl isobutyrate, β-pinene and butyl butyrate) identified from two damaged plant species were considered the most effective HIPVs that attract H. variegata. These findings provide possibilities for the development of H. variegata attractants. They also provide a theoretical basis for the biological prevention and control of aphids using H. variegata.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "“Self-healing” has emerged as a concept to increase the functional stability and durability of polymer materials in applications and thus to benefit the sustainability of polymer-based technologies. Recently, van der Waals (vdW)-driven “self-healing” of sequence-controlled acrylate-based copolymers due to “key-and-lock”- or “ring-and-lock”-type interactions has generated considerable interest as a viable route toward engineering polymers with “self-healing” ability. This contribution systematically evaluates the time, temperature, and composition dependence of the mechanical recovery of acrylate-based copolymer and homopolymer systems subject to cut-and-adhere testing. “Self-healing” in n-butyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate (BA/MMA)- or n-butyl acrylate/styrene (BA/Sty)-based copolymers with varying composition and sequence is found to correlate with the bulk viscoelastic properties of materials and to follow a similar trend as other tested acrylate-based homo- and copolymers. This suggests that “self-healing” in this class of materials is more related to the chain dynamics of bulk materials rather than composition- or sequence-dependent specific interactions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the pursuit of new polymer materials based on renewable raw materials has been intensified with the aim of reusing waste materials in sustainable processes. The synthesis of a lignin, styrene, and butyl acrylate based composite was carried out by a mass polymerization process. A series of four composites were prepared by varying the amount of lignin in 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt.% keeping the content of butyl acrylate constant (14 wt.%). FTIR and SEM revealed that the –OH functional groups of lignin reacted with styrene, which was observed by the incorporation of lignin in the copolymer. Additionally, DSC analysis showed that the increment in lignin loading in the composite had a positive influence on thermal stability. Likewise, Shore D hardness assays exhibited an increase from 25 to 69 when 5 and 20 wt.% lignin was used respectively. In this same sense, the contact angle (water) measurement showed that the LEBA15 and LEBA20 composites presented hydrophobic properties (whit contact angle above 90°) despite having the highest amount of lignin, demonstrating that the interaction of the polymer chains with the –OH groups of lignin was the main mechanism in the composites interaction.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Membrane gas separation provides a multitude of benefits over alternative separation techniques, especially in terms of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. While polymeric membranes have been extensively investigated for gas separations, their self-healing capabilities have often been neglected. In this work, we have developed innovative self-healing amphiphilic copolymers by strategically incorporating three functional segments: n-butyl acrylate (BA), N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide (NMA), and methacrylic acid (MAA). Utilizing these three functional components, we have synthesized two distinct amphiphilic copolymers, namely, APNMA (PBAx-co-PNMAy) and APMAA (PBAx-co-PMAAy). These copolymers have been meticulously designed for gas separation applications. During the creation of these amphiphilic copolymers, BA and NMA segments were selected due to their vital role in the ease of tuning mechanical and self-healing properties. The functional groups (-OH and -NH) present on the NMA segment interact with CO2 through hydrogen bonding, thereby boosting CO2/N2 separation and achieving superior selectivity. We assessed the self-healing potential of these amphiphilic copolymer membranes using two distinct strategies: conventional and vacuum-assisted self-healing. In the vacuum-assisted approach, a robust vacuum pump generates a suction force, leading to the formation of a cone-like shape in the membrane. This formation allows common fracture sites to adhere and trigger the self-healing process. As a result, APNMA maintains its high gas permeability and CO2/N2 selectivity even after the vacuum-assisted self-healing operation. The ideal CO2/N2 selectivity of the APNMA membrane aligns closely with the commercially available PEBAX-1657 membrane (17.54 vs 20.09). Notably, the gas selectivity of the APNMA membrane can be readily restored after damage, in contrast to the PEBAX-1657 membrane, which loses its selectivity upon damage.",

These blends are engineered to achieve optimal mechanical properties and toughness with a reactive epoxidized styrene-acrylic copolymer (ESAC) compatibilizer, and an ethylene-n-butyl-acrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate (EBA-GMA) elastomer-based compatibilizer. The results showed that the tensile strength, modulus, flexural strength and modulus of the PBT increase, while the elongation at break and notched impact strength decrease after blending with the biopolymer PLA. The full co-continuity of PLA in PBT was confirmed at a 50/50 wt% blend ratio. The droplet size of the PLA was reduced and the distinct phases of the blends were gradually diminished with the increasing content of the ESAC compatibilizer. The increase in the complex viscosity of the blends was due to the formation of PLA-g-PBT copolymers in the blend after addition of reactive compatibilizers. The incorporation of both compatibilizers in the blends led to superior notched impact strength in comparison to only a single compatibilizer used in the blends. The synergistic effect of both compatibilizers effectively reduces the PLA droplet size and improves the dispersion of PLA in PBT as evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography observations. The high toughness of the blends corresponds to the formation of effective EBA-GMA structures and enhanced interfacial compatibilization due to the synergistic effect of the compatibilizers.",

This methodology was successfully applied to produce a variety of polymer architectures, including multi-arm star homopolymers and dual-responsive diblock and triblock copolymers. Among these, the synthesized 4-arm star [poly(N,N-dimethyl acrylamide)-block-poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(butyl acrylate)]4-Br [4-arm star (PDMA-b-PDMAEMA-b-PBA)4-Br] triblock copolymer was used to assess pH and temperature responsiveness. This work introduces a sustainable, metal-free route for the development of next-generation smart polymers suitable for biomedical and environmental applications and highlights the versatility of S-dots as a catalyst.",

    "abstract": "The recognized difficulties of pigment dyeing on cotton fabric are the large particle size of the pigment and low affinity between pigment particles and cotton fabric. The dispersion stability of the pigment and binding force between pigment particles and cotton fabric are important factors. To increase the stability of pigment dispersion, fluorescent pigment latex was prepared by encapsulating poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) on the surface of C.I. Solvent Yellow 43. As a reactive emulsifier, allyloxy nonyl alcohol polyoxyethylene (10) ether sulfate can copolymerize with methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate to endow the fluorescent pigment latex with negative charges. To improve the binding force between pigment particles and cotton fabric, the knitted cotton fabric was cationized. The prepared fluorescent pigment latex was further applied to dyeing of cationic fabrics by the exhaust dyeing process. Moreover, pseudo first- and second-order kinetic models were used to examine the adsorption kinetic data of fluorescent pigment latex on cationic cotton fabric. The results showed that the adsorption kinetic followed the pseudo second-order kinetic model, which indicated that the chemical sorption is a rate-limiting step, rather than mass transfer. The activation parameters were also evaluated to confirm the thermodynamic feasibility and spontaneous nature of cationic cotton dyeing with fluorescent pigment latex.",

Using variable temperature turbidimetry, the thermoresponsive behavior of blended diblock copolymer self-assemblies is assessed and compared to the thermoresponsive behavior of the constituent pure diblock copolymer micelles to determine whether comicellization is achieved and more significantly, whether the two blended corona-forming thermoresponsive blocks exhibit cooperative behavior. Interestingly, blended diblock copolymer micelles composed of p(DEGMA)/p(OEGMA) mixed coronae display cooperative behavior, highlighting the potential of copolymer blending for the preparation of stimuli-responsive nanomaterials in applications such as oil recovery, drug delivery, biosensing, and catalysis.",

The three components were sequentially fed in pairs, varying feed composition along the conversion using S as the common monomer. To prepare a reference material, an industrial method was utilized with those monomers, using an equivalent global composition in a two-stage batch process (TS).

The changes in glass transition temperature were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).

Here, we report a strategy to create degradable poly(acrylate) PSAs using simple, scalable, and functional 1,2-dithiolanes as drop-in replacements for traditional acrylate comonomers. Our key building block is α-lipoic acid, a natural, biocompatible, and commercially available antioxidant found in various consumer supplements. α-Lipoic acid and its derivative ethyl lipoate efficiently copolymerize with n-butyl acrylate under conventional free-radical conditions leading to high-molecular-weight copolymers (Mn > 100 kg mol-1) containing a tunable concentration of degradable disulfide bonds along the backbone. The thermal and viscoelastic properties of these materials are practically indistinguishable from nondegradable poly(acrylate) analogues, but a significant reduction in molecular weight is realized upon exposure to reducing agents such as tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (e.g., Mn = 198 kg mol-1 → 2.6 kg mol-1). By virtue of the thiol chain ends produced after disulfide cleavage, degraded oligomers can be further cycled between high and low molecular weights through oxidative repolymerization and reductive degradation. Transforming otherwise persistent poly(acrylates) into recyclable materials using simple and versatile chemistry could play a pivotal role in improving the sustainability of contemporary adhesives.",

However, PVAc emulsion requires plasticizers, which inherently have challenges resulting in deteriorating thermal and mechanical properties. Hence, the present work focuses on formulating a plasticizer-free adhesive by copolymerizing vinyl acetate with butyl acrylate (BA). The physical, thermal, and mechanical properties of BA-incorporated adhesives were analyzed by viscosity, pH, water contact angle, pencil hardness test of films, and differential scanning calorimetry. Optimizing strategy by varying the content of BA was evaluated. The shear strength of the samples on the wood specimen was verified in dry conditions at various intervals, and in wet conditions as per EN 204 standard. The viscosity of the adhesives exhibited a positive shift, as the concentration BA increased. The hardness of PVAc films was also altered positively by the addition of BA. Water contact angle measurement unveiled the hydrophobic nature of BA incorporation. The performance of the newly formulated adhesive tested on dry conditions showed enhanced tensile shear strength, and the values were maximum for 1 wt. % BA sample. Tensile shear strength value measured at dry conditions after 7 d of drying displayed an increment of ∼5.5% on 1 wt. % BA sample, compared to pristine adhesive. Analysis at wet conditions also corroborated enhanced performance with BA incorporation. Hence by optimizing the content of BA, a new concept of PVAc emulsion adhesive without any plasticizer can be formulated, with enhanced water resistance and performance.",

Aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, and isocyanates dominated the emission profiles, with ACR–PUR releasing markedly higher concentrations of symptom-relevant compounds. Acute exposure was linked to toluene, styrene, phenol, and methyl butyl ketone (MBK), which decreased sharply within 60 days, while compounds such as 1,3-dioxolane, isopropylbenzene, and ethenyl acetate exhibited persistent emissions, suggesting increased chronic risk.

To study whether copolymerization provides a more favorable result, dibutyl itaconate was copolymerized with n-butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and styrene. In addition to representing the most commercially preferred monomer families, these co-monomers were also chosen due to the differences in the secondary reactions that occur during polymerization at elevated temperatures. Experiments were conducted under semi-batch operating conditions at 110 °C with equal molar ratios of the co-monomer to dibutyl itaconate to enable direct comparison of the results. The impact of varying monomer compositions on polymer molecular mass distributions and polymerization rates was studied, with samples analysed using size exclusion chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.",

Two types of end groups originated from the BPO initiator—benzoyloxy and phenyl terminal groups—were individually determined by stepwise chemolysis-pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC) using a double-shot furnace pyrolyzer. In the first (chemolysis) step, the copolymer sample was mixed with tetramethylammonium hydroxide and introduced into the pyrolyzer at 250°C for 10min. During this step, the benzoyloxy terminal groups were selectively and quantitatively decomposed into methyl benzoate through the thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation of ester linkages, which was clearly observed in the pyrogram. In the second step, the residual polymer sample was analyzed by ordinary Py-GC at 600°C. In the observed pyrogram, benzene and C14H12 were separately detected as the key products reflecting the phenyl terminal groups among the various pyrolyzates of the polymer main chain. Based on the peak intensities of these characteristic products, the relative contents of both types of the end groups from BPO were estimated to be almost proportional to the feed amounts of BPO. Moreover, it was determined that the number of benzoyloxy end groups was roughly twice of that of the phenyl terminal groups.",

Macromolecular chemistry can provide appropriately tailored functional polymers with desired healing properties. Herein, we report the incorporation of glycidyl methacrylate-based (GMA) copolymers in waterborne polyurethanes (WPUs) and the study of their potential healing ability. Two types of copolymers were synthesized, namely the hydrophobic P(BA-co-GMAy) copolymers of GMA with n-butyl acrylate (BA) and the amphiphilic copolymers P(PEGMA-co-GMAy) of GMA with a poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) macromonomer. We demonstrate that the blending of these types of copolymers with two WPUs leads to homogenous composites. While the addition of P(BA-co-GMAy) in the WPUs leads to amorphous materials, the addition of P(PEGMA-co-GMAy) copolymers leads to hybrid composite systems varying from amorphous to semi-crystalline, depending on copolymer or blend composition. The healing efficiency of these copolymers was explored upon application of two external triggers (addition of water or heating).

Tumor hypoxia often correlates with the recurrence and metastasis of the tumor and is the critical factor limiting the treatment effect of TAE. Purpose To investigate the underlying mechanism and therapeutic potential of TAE combined with apatinib-loaded p(N-isopropyl-acrylamide-co-butyl methyl acrylate) temperature-sensitive (PIB) nanogel for the suppression of rabbit VX2 liver tumor growth. Materials and Methods Sixty-five VX2 tumor-burdened rabbits were randomly divided into five groups and treated transarterially with apatinib-loaded PIB (Group PA, 0.4 mL, n=13), PIB alone (Group P, 0.4 mL, n=13), iodized oil alone (Group I, 0.4 mL, n=13), apatinib solution (Group A, 0.4 mL, n=13) or saline (Group NS, 0.4 mL, n=13). The dose of apatinib was 2 mg/kg. Tumors were harvested, sectioned and immunohistochemically stained, and the tumor growth rates and survival times in each group were measured. Blood samples and liver tissues were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Results The tumor growth rate in Group PA was considerably lower than the other four groups (P=0.000<0.01), and the survival time was significantly prolonged (P=0.000<0.01). The immunohistochemistry results showed that CD31 expression was significantly lower in Group PA than that of the other four groups (P=0.000<0.01). The apatinib concentration in the blood fell below 10 ng/mL within 10 min after TAE and dropped below 1 ng/mL after 8 h. The drug was released continuously in the liver for 36 days, with the highest concentration at the tumor junction (P=0.045<0.05). Conclusion PIB effectively targeted apatinib to HCC tissues, achieved a slow and sustained release of the drug in the tumor and considerably reduced the systemic drug concentration. Further experiments showed significantly prolonged survival times and an inhibitory effect on tumor growth.",

This network creates a template for the formation of composite foams, whose swelling behavior is sensitive to the composition of the solvent, and whose electrical resistance is sensitive to physical deformation. The self‐assembly of graphene sheets is driven thermodynamically, as graphite is found to act as a 2D surfactant and is spread at high‐energy interfaces. This spreading, or exfoliation, of graphite at an oil/water interface stabilizes water‐in‐oil emulsions, without the need for added surfactants or chemical modification of the graphene. Using a monomer such as butyl acrylate for the emulsion's oil phase, elastomeric foams are created by polymerizing the continuous oil phase. Removal of the aqueous phase then results in robust, conductive, porous, and inexpensive composites, with potential applications in energy storage, filtration, and sensing.",

Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) was dispersed in the polyacrylic latex to prepare PBMG/CNC dispersions with different CNC contents. The dried product was mixed with polylactic acid (PLA) to fabricate PLA/PBMG/CNC blends. The addition of PBMG and PBMG/CNC improved the mechanical properties of the PLA matrix. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to investigate the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics. The Avrami equation modified by the Jeziorny, Ozawa and Mo equations was used to analyze the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of PLA and its blends. Analysis of the crystallization halftime of non-isothermal conditions indicated that the overall rate of crystallization increased significantly at 1 wt% content of CNC. This seemed to result from the increase of nucleation density and the acceleration of segment movement in the presence of the CNC component. This phenomenon was verified by polarizing microscope observation.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the primary objective is to investigate the impact of various particles on the hydrophobic characteristics of a coating. The experimental approach involves employing a conventional chemical precipitation method to fabricate ZnO particles. Subsequently, composite materials of SiO2-ZnO are synthesized based on these ZnO particles. The coating is formulated using styrene-butyl methacrylate as the principal raw material. Different particles, namely TiO2, SiO2, ZnO, and ZnO-SiO2, are individually added to the coating, allowing for the exploration of the influence of distinct mass ratios on the resulting hydrophobic angle.\nThe findings of this investigation reveal a notable trend in the contact angles of the four materials as the mass ratio varies. Initially, the contact angles experience an increase, followed by a subsequent decrease. Remarkably, when the mass ratio of ZnO-SiO2 is set at 60%, the contact angle achieves an impressive 152.5°, meeting the criteria for superhydrophobicity. In comparison to a pure acrylate polymer coating, the incorporation of particles induces agglomeration on the coating's surface. This agglomeration can be conceptualized as clustered particles, contributing to heightened surface roughness in the coating and consequently enhancing its hydrophobic properties.\nThe observed variations in contact angles underscore the nuanced interplay between mass ratios and hydrophobicity, shedding light on the optimization possibilities for achieving superhydrophobic coatings. The study suggests that manipulating the composition of particles within the coating formulation can be a viable strategy for tailoring hydrophobic properties. Furthermore, the surface modifications induced by particle incorporation provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the hydrophobic behavior. This research contributes to the broader understanding of materials science and surface engineering, offering potential applications in areas where superhydrophobic coatings are desirable, such as anti-fouling surfaces, self-cleaning materials, and advanced protective coatings. The exploration of such multifaceted relationships between particle composition and hydrophobicity holds promise for the development of innovative materials with tailored surface properties.",

    "abstract": "In our previous work, poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) latex microspheres (LMs) were embedded within hydrogels to enhance their mechanical strength. Herein, acrylonitrile (AN) components were added to the latex system to prepare novel poly(butyl acrylate-acrylonitrile) (P(BA-AN)) LMs. LMs were able to adsorb hydrophobic hexadecyl methacrylate (HMA) due to hydrophobic interactions, stabilized by using sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactants. The HMA could occur radical copolymerization with acrylamide (AAm) under the redox initiators to form P(HMA-AAm)-P(BA-AN) hydrogels. The intra and interchain non-permanent binding could be promoted in P(BA-AN) LMs due to the dipole-dipole interactions of -CN groups from acrylonitrile. As a result, P(BA-AN) LMs were utilized to fabricate tough hydrogels as crosslinking centers for hydrophobic association. The mechanical properties of the hydrogels exhibited a fracture stress of 775 KPa, an ultrastretchable strain of 3600% and a fracture energy of approximately 7600 KJ/m3. This innovative design strategy for LMs capable of strong physicochemical interactions, including electrostatic and hydrogen-bond interactions and coordination effects, may open a novel direction for the production of tough hydrogels.",

    "abstract": "A hypervalent (HV) iodine(III)-containing crosslinker, (diacryloyloxyiodo)benzene, is synthesized and its crystal structure is reported. Highly branched polymers with hypervalent iodine(III) groups as the building blocks present at the branching points are synthesized by copolymerization of tert-butyl acrylate and the diacrylate crosslinker (up to 12 mol% vs the monovinyl monomer), under reversible deactivation radical polymerization (iodine transfer polymerization) conditions, which are employed to ensure that the incorporation of the crosslinker into the polymer chains is slow and gradual, that is, to limit the average number of pendant double bonds per chain and delay gelation. The branched polymers with (diacyloxyiodo)benzene-type linkers are responsive and react with monocarboxylic acids, for example, acetic acid, which participate in ligand-exchange reactions with the HV iodine(III) centers, and with reducing agents, for example, tributylphosphine, which reduce iodine(III) to iodine(I); both reactions lead to polymer degradation with the formation of random linear copolymers of tert-butyl acrylate and acrylic acid.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "\n Safe and reliable fueling components are essential for large scale deployment of H2 fuel. Field data has shown that existing materials used in dispensing hoses do not meet current standards for component reliability. Currently modern copolymerization methods are under investigation to create a new platform for inner hose technologies using self-healable copolymers. Ideally these inexpensive self-healable copolymer inner layers will reduce the cost of H2 delivery hoses and extend their service life beyond 25,000 refills.\n In this work gas driven hydrogen permeability measurements were performed on a variety of self-healing copolymer membranes all of which have exhibited excellent self-healing properties in previous studies. Copolymers were prepared with Poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate/n-butyl acrylate) [p(TFEMA/nBA)] and Poly(methyl methacrylate/nbutyl acrylate) [p(MMA/nBA)]. Measurements were performed through a range of temperatures and source pressures. Additionally, the effects of composition, copolymer ratio, and molecular weight on the hydrogen permeability, solubility, and diffusivity were all studied. As expected, hydrogen permeation through the samples is proportional to the source pressure and inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the polymer. In general, the self-healing copolymers exhibit hydrogen permeabilities consistent with literature data for similar elastomers. These results suggest this class of self-healable copolymers may be promising candidates for use as inexpensive inner layers in hydrogen dispensing hoses with extended service life.",

In this study, starch/zein bioparticles (BPs) obtained by nanoprecipitation were employed to synthesize acrylic polymer/biopolymer waterborne nanoparticles with excellent film formation capability. These hybrid nanoparticle dispersions were obtained through a semibatch emulsion polymerization using the previously synthesized BPs as seed and variable monomeric formulations composed of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate. A synergetic effect between acrylic and biopolymer phases was evidenced where the incorporation of BPs had a fundamental role in improving sensitive properties, such as film blocking resistance, while attaining smooth films at room temperature. These excellent film-forming properties of starch/acrylic hybrid latexes without requiring the addition of formulation agents, which depict an important benefit from an environmental viewpoint, demonstrate that they represent a promising alternative for the development of a new generation of eco-friendly binders.",

Great differences were found in the adhesive performance according to the ACN weight ratio. Its increased resulted in a considerable rise in the average sol molecular weight and in the glass transition temperature. This was reflected in a decrease of adhesion forces (peel resistance and tack) and an increase of the cohesion forces (shear resistance). Moreover, the incorporation of the minimum amount of ACN studied showed a great change in the elastic modulus determined by dynamic shear resistance with respect to the based formulation that did not contain ACN.

However, overall reaction rates (as indicated by free monomer concentrations), polymer molar masses, and branching levels did not vary as copolymer HEA content was increased from 0 to 40 wt % in the semi-batch system. In contrast, introduction of a H-bonding solvent, n-pentanol, led to an observable decrease in branching levels, and branching levels were also reduced in batch (co)polymerizations with HEA.

    "abstract": "In this study, instead of using the usual chemical methods, poly(butyl acrylate)/silicon dioxide (PBA/SiO2) core-shell composite microspheres were prepared using a physical method-ultrasonically initiated encapsulation emulsion polymerization. The morphology and particle size of the PBA/SiO2 microspheres were analysed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The encapsulation state was determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The composition and thermogravimetric behavior were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TEM and DLS results show that monodisperse PBA/SiO2 core-shell composite microspheres were successfully obtained. The diameter and shell thickness were 150 nm and 15 nm, respectively. The XPS and FTIR results show that there was no new chemical bond between the PBA shell and the SiO2 core. They were just combined by physical adsorption. The encapsulation efficiency of SiO2 microspheres by PBA is 8.2% through TGA. In addition, this article focuses on the formation mechanism of PBA/SiO2 core-shell microspheres prepared through ultrasonically initiated encapsulation emulsion polymerization. Intuitive observation and the results of TEM and DLS, especially the change in zeta potential, clearly indicate an encapsulation process. Thereinto, a bilayer-structure space established by appropriate amount of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) molecules is the key to realize ultrasonically initiated encapsulation emulsion polymerization.",

    "abstract": "Herein, this work aims to fabricate well-ordered nanonetwork epoxy resin modified with poly(butyl acrylate)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PBA-b-PMMA) block copolymer (BCP) for enhanced energy dissipation using a self-assembled diblock copolymer of polystyrene-b-poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PS-b-PDMS) with gyroid and diamond structures as templates. A systematic study of mechanical properties using nanoindentation of epoxy resin with gyroid- and diamond-structures after modification revealed significant enhancement in energy dissipation, with the values of 0.36 ± 0.02 nJ (gyroid) and 0.43 ± 0.03 nJ (diamond), respectively, when compared to intrinsic epoxy resin (approximately 0.02 ± 0.002 nJ) with brittle characteristics. This enhanced property is attributed to the synergic effect of the deliberate structure with well-ordered nanonetwork texture and the toughening of BCP-based modifiers at the molecular level. In addition to the deliberate structural effect from the nanonetwork texture, the BCP modifier composed of epoxy-philic hard segment and epoxy-phobic soft segment led to dispersed soft-segment domains in the nanonetwork-structured epoxy matrix with superior interfacial strength for the enhancement of applied energy dissipation.",

    "abstract": "A soft‐segment homopolymer of the monomer butyl acrylate was synthesized by miniemulsion polymerization to study the unique properties of poly(n‐butyl acrylate) [P(nBuA)] as flexible coating. The nanostructure and linear properties of P(nBuA) synthesized using radiation and radical polymerization techniques were investigated. The molar mass and particle size of the prepared P(nBuA) polymers were characterized using size‐exclusion chromatography and a particle‐size analyzer, respectively. Photo‐initiation of P(nBuA) was induced by 2,2‐dimethoxy‐2‐phenylacetophenone in the presence of the crosslinkers polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), bisphenol A ethoxylated diacrylate (BPAEDA), or trimethylpropane triacrylate (TMPTA), followed by crosslinking by ionizing radiation. The dynamic mechanical analysis parameters—tangent delta, storage modulus, and loss modulus—were determined for the three prepared crosslinked polymers of P(nBuA) and showed that P(nBuA‐BPAEDA), P(nBuA‐PEGDA), and P(nBuA‐TMPTA) are strong and flexible materials. Thermal gravimetric analysis was used to study the thermal behavior of the prepared elastic P(nBuA) polymers. Thermal gravimetric data revealed that the crosslinkers improved the thermal stability of P(nBuA). The favorable properties of the synthesized polymers indicate their potential to be used as flexible nanocoatings for packaging materials.",

    "abstract": "Simple routes to self-healing Biology provides many routes for self-healing or repair, but this trait is hard to endow into engineering materials. Although self-repair has been demonstrated for some polymers, it usually required specialized monomers. Urban et al. demonstrate that for a very narrow range of compositions, simple vinyl polymers based on methyl methacrylate and n-butyl acrylate show repeatable self-healing properties (see the Perspective by Sumerlin). A key characteristic of this system is that it relies on van der Waals interactions rather than the reformation of hydrogen or covalent bonds for repair. Science, this issue p. 220; see also p. 150 Commodity monomers are combined via a simple and scalable copolymerization to form self-healing polymers. Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from physical or chemical damage. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon mechanical damage. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals forces forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals forces instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and physical alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical damage without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals forces upon mechanical damage is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated alternating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.",

The viscoelastic and mechanical behaviors of the resulting networks are carefully characterized using a combination of techniques, including linear rheology, dynamic mechanical analysis, and tensile testing.

These properties are different from those of classical electrochemically obtained polypyrrole. Due to their capacitive properties, polypyrrole nanospheres layers were applied as a solid contact in ion‐selective electrodes, on example of a potassium‐selective potentiometric sensor.

Investigation of the thermal properties with DSC demonstrates that both mILs have a Tg temperature of about 180 K and a melting point around 310 K.

In recent years, numerous functional materials have been developed based on block copolymers (BCPs), however, like homopolymers, their chains could undergo mechanochemical damage during processing, which could have crucial impact on their performance. To investigate the mechanochemical response of BCPs, multiple polymers comprising different ratios of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with similar degree of polymerization and stressed in solution via ultrasonication. Interestingly, all BCPs, regardless of the amount of the methacrylate monomer, presented a mechanochemistry rate constant similar to that of the methacrylate homopolymer, while a random copolymer reacted like the acrylate homopolymer. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that, in addition to the typical main peak shift towards higher retention times, a different daughter fragment was produced indicating a secondary selective scission site, situated around the covalent connection between the two blocks. Molecular dynamics modeling using acrylate and methacrylate oligomers were carried out and indicated that dynamic phase separation occurs even in a good solvent. Such non-random conformations can explain the faster polymer mechanochemistry. Moreover, the dynamic model for end-to-end chain overstretching supports bond scission which is not necessarily chain-centered.",

One impurity commonly found in CLA, oleic acid, was shown to influence the reaction kinetics significantly. Adhesive performance was tuned using divinylbenzene (DVB) crosslinker to keep the terpolymer molecular weight in a desired range. By using a constrained mixture design, the influence of terpolymer composition, chain transfer agent (CTA) concentration, DVB concentration, molecular weights, viscosity and particle size on tack, peel strength and shear strength was investigated.

Techniques based on miniemulsion polymerization using GO as surfactant and \"physical mixing\" approaches (i.e. mixing an aqueous polymer latex with an aqueous GO dispersion) are employed, followed by heat treatment of the films to convert GO to rGO. The distribution of GO sheets and the electrical conductivity depend strongly on the preparation method, with electrical conductivities in the range 9 x 10-4 - 3.4 x 102 S/m. Higher electrical conductivities are obtained using physical mixing compared to miniemulsion polymerization, attributed to the former providing a higher level of self-alignment of rGO into larger linear domains.

    "abstract": "Oily wastewater has caused serious threats to the environment; thus, high-performance absorbing materials for effective oil-water separation technology have attracted increasing attention. Herein, we develop a magnetic, hydrophobic, and lipophilic hyperporous elastic material (HEM) templated by high internal phase emulsions (HIPE), in which free-radical polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA) and divinylbenzene (DVB) is employed in the presence of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), lecithin surfactant, and modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The adoption of the emulsion template with nanoparticles as both stabilizers and cross-linkers endows the HEM with biomimetic hierarchical open-cell micropores and elastic cross-linked networks, generating an oil absorbent with outstanding mechanical stability. Compressive fatigue resistance of the HEM is demonstrated to endure 2000 mechanical cycles without plastic deformation or strength degradation. By exploiting the synergistic effect of hierarchical structures and low-surface-energy components, the resulting HEM also possesses excellent and robust hydrophobicity (water contact angle of 164°) and good oil absorption capacity, in which Fe3O4 nanoparticles lead to convenient magnetically controlled oil recyclability as well. Notably, the unique biomimetic microporous structure demonstrates superior oil retention capacity (>95% at 1000 rpm and >60% at 10,000 rpm) over the state-of-the-art porous materials for a diverse variety of oils to reduce the risk of secondary oil leakage, along with good recoverability by squeezing owing to the excellent compression resilience. These excellent performances of our HEM provide broad prospects for practical applications in oil-water separation, energy conversion, and smart soft robotics.",

Engineering polymeric vectors, by exploring novel topologies and cationic moieties, is a promising avenue to improve their performance, which hinges on the development of simple synthetic methods that allow facile preparation. In this work, we focus on cationic micelles formed from block polymers, which are examined as promising gene compaction agents and carriers. In this study, we report the synthesis and assembly of six amphiphilic poly(n-butyl acrylate)-b-poly(cationic acrylamide) diblock polymers with different types of cationic groups ((dialkyl)amine, morpholine, or imidazole) in their hydrophilic corona. The polycations were obtained through the parallel postpolymerization modification of a poly(n-butyl acrylate)-b-poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) reactive scaffold, which granted diblock polymers with equivalent degrees of polymerization and subsequent quantitative functionalization with cations of different pKa. Ultrasound-assisted direct dissolution of the polycations in different aqueous buffers (pH = 1-7) afforded micellar structures with low size dispersities and hydrodynamic radii below 100 nm. The formation and properties of micelle-DNA complexes (\"micelleplexes\") were explored via DLS, zeta potential, and dye-exclusion assays revealing that binding is influenced by the cation type present in the micelle corona where bulkiness and pKa are the drivers of micelleplex formation. Combining parallel synthesis strategies with simple direct dissolution formulation opens opportunities to optimize and expand the range of micelle delivery vehicles available by facile tuning of the composition of the cationic micelle corona.",

The compositions of the resulting ternary latex copolymers were varied in terms of both “soft” (HOSBM, BA) and “rigid” (MMA or St) macromolecular fragments, while total monomer conversion and molecular weight of copolymers were determined after synthesis. For most latexes, results indicated the presence of lower and higher molecular weight fractions, which is beneficial for the material adhesive performance. To correlate surface properties and adhesive performance of HOSBM-based copolymer latexes, contact angle hysteresis (using water as a contact liquid) for each latex-substrate pair was first determined. The data showed that plant oil-based latexes exhibit a clear ability to spread and adhere once applied on the surface of materials differing by polarities, such as semicrystalline polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), bleached paperboard (uncoated), and tops coated with a clay mineral paperboard. The effectiveness of plant oil-based ternary latexes as adhesives was demonstrated on PET to PP and coated to uncoated paperboard substrates. As a result, the latexes with high biobased content developed in this study provide promising adhesive performance, causing substrate failure instead of cohesive/adhesive break in many experiments.",

We evaluated the efficacy, the safety, and the cost-effectiveness of two strategies for non-inferiority in controlling bacterial colonization of the exit-site of Peripherally-Inserted Central Catheters (PICC). Methods: After PICC placement, a skin swab of the exit site was taken and cultured. In group A the exit site was sealed with N-butyl-cyanoacrylate glue, while in group B a chlorhexidine-releasing sponge dressing was applied. A second skin culture was taken at day 7. Results: A total of 51 patients were enrolled in each group. In 42 patients the second skin culture was not performed because of 20 patients were lost at follow-up or deceased and in 22 patients the dressing needed to be changed early, because of local bleeding (13 cases, in group B) or because of dressing detachment (four in group A and five in group B). The microbiological study was completed in 36 patients in group A and 24 in group B. No microorganisms were isolated in any patient. Conclusions: Both strategies were effective in controlling bacterial colonization. Glue was effective in reducing local bleeding, and it was more cost-effective than sponge dressing. During the first week, when local bleeding and bacterial colonization must be prevented, glue might be more appropriate than chlorhexidine-releasing dressing; after the first week chlorhexidine-releasing dressing might be preferable, considering that the safety of glue application on the skin for prolonged periods is still questionable.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of a naphthyl curing agent (NCA) can enhance the thermal stability of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs). In this study, a PSA matrix was synthesized using a solution polymerization process and consisted of butyl acrylate, acrylic acid, and an ethyl acrylate within an acrylic copolymer. Benzoyl peroxide was used as an initiator during the synthesis. To facilitate the UV curing of the solvent-borne PSAs, glycidyl methacrylate was added to introduce unsaturated carbon double bonds. The resulting UV-curable acrylic PSA tapes exhibited longer holding times at high temperatures (150 °C) compared to uncross-linked PSA tapes, without leaving any residues on the substrate surface. The thermal stability of the PSA was further enhanced by adding more NCA and increasing the UV dosage. This may be attributed to the formation of cross-linking networks within the polymer matrix at higher doses. The researchers successfully balanced the adhesion performance and thermal stability by modifying the amount of NCA and UV radiation, despite the peel strength declining and the holding duration shortening. This research also investigated the effects of cross-linking density on gel content, molecular weight, glass transition temperature, and other properties of the PSAs.",

    "abstract": "The development of methods and techniques for protecting the surfaces of steel structure exposed to aggressive environments, e.g. sea water, presents itself as an urgent task in material science. One of the directions in solving these problems involves the application of paints and enamels based on organic binders. The promising aspects of this direction are due to the possibilities of creating compositions by varying the physicochemical properties and colloidal chemical qualities of the components – film formers, binders, pigments and fillers. In this study, properties of protective coatings based on acrylic latex are examined together with their dependency on anti-corrosion additives and pigments using the corrosion test methods described in a number of state standards. In the corrosion test programme, an EDX-800HS X-ray spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan), ShS 80-01 SPU oven and an HR-150AZ analytical balance with weighing accuracy up to ±0.0001 g were applied in conjunction with a number of other modern instruments. The application of acrylic latex based on butyl acrylate ester monomers and styrene as a protective coating was proved to be ineffective in the case of metal surfaces subjected to aggressive action. The work provides the compositions optimal in terms of chemical formula, dispersion and quantitative ratios and possible to significantly increase the protective ability of anticorrosion coatings. The addition of a pigment based on zinc phosphate and sodium nitrite as an anti-corrosion additive to the composition of the Rzhavostop acrylic enamel significantly increases the protective properties of the composition. The enamel-coated samples of St3 steel exhibit no signs of corrosion for up to 2–3 days of maintaining in model solutions of sea water. The enrichment of Rzhavostop acrylic enamel with black pigment with at least 95 % of 3-di(2-hydroxyethylamino) propionic acid 2-ethylhexyl ester greatly enhances the effect of the film former adhering to the metal surface. The addition of zinc tetraoxychromate complements the effect and prevents corrosion from spreading over the surface. In 7–8 days, no signs of corrosion were detected in St3 steel samples of under the considered conditions. The authors declare no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article.",

    "abstract": "Higher biocidability of fluorinated quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) is usually contributed to its preferential segregation to the surface to better contact with and kill bacteria. However, whether its structure also elicits better performance is still unclear. Herein, the same amount of a fluorinated QAS and its nonfluorinated counterpart are both immobilized on the top surface to eliminate the effect of concentration distribution to only study their structure-biocidability relationship. Briefly, the fluorinated and nonfluorinated QASs were synthesized by quaternization of N,N-dimethylethanolamine with 2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl bromide that was prepared by bromination of 2-(perfluorooctyl)ethanol and 1-bromodecane, respectively. Polystyrene (PS) and diblock copolymer poly(styrene)-b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PS-PtBA) were successively spin coated on SiO2 wafers at different concentrations to form bilayer structures that have a PS base layer and a PtBA top layer. The tert-butyl acrylate groups of the PtBA layer of 0.9 nm were converted to carboxylic acid groups with trifluoroacetic acid for respective esterification with the two hydroxy-containing QASs. It was observed that the fluorinated and nonfluorinated surfaces fabricated at the maximum comparable esterification yield of 63.5% fully eradicated ∼104 CFU of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in 120 and 150 min, respectively, indicating that the fluorocarbon chain is more biocidal through better interpenetration into bacterial membranes.

Then the toughness, dynamic mechanical property, and morphology of the PVC/ASA blends were investigated. The results indicated that the impact strength of the PVC/ASA blends increased and then decreased with the increase of the AN content in poly(styrene‐co‐acrylonitrile (SAN) copolymer, and increased with the increase of the core‐shell ratio of ASA. It was shown that brittle‐ductile transition of PVC/ASA blends was dependent on poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) rubber content in blends and independent of AN content in SAN copolymer.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) curves exhibited that PVC and SAN copolymers were immiscible over the entire AN composition range.

Although structures of the products were unspecified, it was expected to be mixtures of block copolymers and homopolymers. Subsequently prepared P(AA‐co‐BA) on CμC/PP (5/95 wt/wt) composites expressed a superior mechanical toughness, which had increased threefold when compared to intact CμC/PP composite. This increase in toughness was mainly based on an increase in elongation rate, reflecting improvement of the adhesion strength at the interface between CμC surface and PP.

The POE exhibits better free radical scavenging capacity than 3‐(3,5‐di‐tert‐butyl‐4‐hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid 2‐acrylamidoethyl‐N‐phenylmaleimide copolymer (PAN), which possesses an amide bridging structure. As a result, the tensile strength of PA66/POE remains at its original level (82.14 MPa), while the retention of impact strength is 65.4%, decreasing from 6.24 to 4.08 kJ/m2, following 12 days of thermal‐oxidative aging at 150°C. In contrast, the retention of tensile strength and impact strength of PA66/PAN was 48.6% (decreasing from 76.60 to 37.23 MPa) and 49.8% (decreasing from 6.15 to 3.06 kJ/m2), respectively. In addition, POE and PAN have superior antimigration properties in PA66. This work serves as a reference for the development of macromolecular antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of resistance to pathogenic bacteria has resulted from the misuse of antibiotics used in wound treatment. Therefore, nanomaterial-based agents can be used to overcome these limitations. In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL)/gelatin/graphene oxide electrospun nanofibers (PGO) are functionalized via plasma treatment with the monomeric groups diallylamine (PGO-M1), acrylic acid (PGO-M2), and tert-butyl acrylate (PGO-M3) to enhance the action against bacteria cells. The surface functionalization influences the morphology, surface wettability, mechanical properties, and thermal stability of PGO nanofibers. PGO-M1 and PGO-M2 exhibit good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, whereas PGO-M3 tends to reduce their antibacterial properties compared to PGO nanofibers. The highest proportion of dead bacteria cells is found on the surface of hydrophilic PGO-M1, whereas live cells are colonized on the surface of hydrophobic PGO-M3. Likewise, PGO-M1 shows a good interaction with L929, which is confirmed by the high levels of adhesion and proliferation with respect to the control. All the results confirm that surface functionalization can be strategically used as a tool to engineer PGO nanofibers with controlled antibacterial properties for the fabrication of highly versatile devices suitable for different applications (e.g., health, environmental pollution).",

To make it easy, one‐pot emulsion polymerization using n‐butyl acrylate, isobornyl methacrylate (IBOMA), 2‐hydroxyethyl acrylate and acrylic acid was conducted in the presence of a reactive emulsifier SR‐20 to obtain a reinforced adhesive tape. First, the emulsion had good stabilities, especially freeze‐thaw stability, which was helpful to the fabrication of PSAs. Second, IBOMA increased the binding strength between adhesive layer and adherend. The properties of the final tapes well fulfilled the requirements of this areas, such as that the 180° peel strength of 125.9 N/m when coated on non‐corona surfaces, the tack of 19 #, and the shear holding time of more than 100 h. Third, the tapes produced using the above emulsion could be removed many times, with no PSAs residue on the adherend even when coated on untreated PP, which showed the potential of recycling and environmental protection. Thus, these properties make the polyacrylate emulsion have great potential for practical applications. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133, 42886.",

Elevating the molecular weight of ethylene/acrylate copolymer, a typical polar polyolefin, has been a persistent challenge. This study presents the direct synthesis of ultrahigh-molecular-weight (UHMW) ethylene/acrylate copolymers using a highly active, neutral, single-component phosphine-phenolate nickel catalyst under mild conditions. The coordination-insertion copolymerization of ethylene and various acrylates, such as methyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, and t-butyl acrylate, can yield ethylene/acrylate copolymers with UHMWs (Mn) ranging from 1,000 to 2,700 kDa, with exceptional activities of up to 4.03 × 106 g mol-1 h-1. A relatively large-scale synthesis (30-50 g) of UHMW ethylene/acrylate copolymers was notably achieved. The properties of these UHMW ethylene/acrylate copolymers were comprehensively evaluated, demonstrating that these copolymers retained the bulk properties of ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) while exhibiting improved surface and dyeing properties. Particularly, the tensile strength of the ethylene/acrylate copolymers significantly increased with higher molecular weights, reaching 44 MPa (147 MPa after a pre-drawing ratio of 3.1), which is comparable to that of UHMWPE.",

Furthermore, different core-shell ratios 20/80, 30/70, 40/60, and 50/50 were prepared and incorporated into the solid phase of the bone cement formulation at 5, 10, and 15 wt %, respectively. The incorporation of a rubbery phase into the bone cement formulation decreased the bending strength and bending modulus. The AE technique revealed that the nanoparticles play an important role on the fracture mechanism of the bone cement, since a higher amount of AE signals (higher amplitude and energy) were obtained from bone cements that were prepared with the nanoparticles in comparison with those without nanoparticles (the reference bone cement). The SEM examination of the fracture surfaces revealed that all of the bone cement formulations exhibited stress whitening, which arises from the development of crazes before the crack propagation.

In this paper, we report an efficient approach to dispersity control by exploiting the dual functions of NaN3 under the varied solvent polarity. Simultaneous polymerization and chain-end substitution allowed us to tune the Đ values of various polymethacrylates and poly(butyl acrylate). Notably, the Đ value could be tuned to a wide range approximately from 1.2 to 2.0 for polymethacrylates and to 3.8 for poly(butyl acrylate).

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTMechanical properties of heterogeneous systems based on carbon black (CB) filled semi‐crystalline ethylene butyl acrylate (EBA) copolymer nanocomposites are characterized using nano‐indentation technique. The size effect and CB content dependence on the deformation behavior at room temperature were investigated. The phenomenology for hardness response (H) indicates a typical enhancement of the H when the indentation depth (h) decreases as for the usual elastomeric materials. All H–h curves, fitted according to the Meyer's empirical power law and Franck elasticity model, highlight the so‐called length‐scale‐dependent deformation. Similar trend is observed for the elastic modulus. Furthermore, it is evidenced that the increases of CB content increases the mechanical properties of composites, that is, hardness and elastic modulus. This behavior can be mainly related, on the one hand, to the change of the meso‐structure, formed by the interconnected network of polymer and the aggregates of CB particles and to the nature of the polymer matrix, on the other hand. The mechanical properties characterized from micro and submicron indentations were compared to that characterized at macroscopic scale to highlight the possible correlations between the two scales.

Materials based on collagen copolymers with synthetic monomers are promising. The use of hybrid materials also helps to reduce the consumption of non-renewable natural resources. Synthesis of grafted collagen copolymers with polybutyl acrylate was carried out at azobisisobutyronitrile initiation and triethyl borane – oxygen system initiation under comparable conditions under intensive stirring of aqueous solution dispersion of collagen and butyl acrylate. After the synthesis, the aqueous and organic phases of the reaction mixture were analyzed by composition and molecular weight parameters using infrared spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography. Changes indicating the formation of a copolymer are observed in the copolymer isolated from the aqueous phase, more pronounced in the triethyl borane – oxygen system. It is assumed that the formation of copolymer macromolecules for azobisisobutyronitrile and organoelement initiator takes place according to different schemes. Schemes for the formation of copolymer macromolecules for AIBN and an organoelement initiator are proposed. Only polybutyl acrylate is present in the organic phase. Biological studies were carried out for fungal resistance and bactericidal activity of the obtained copolymers.",

The results obtained from FTIR exhibit a good agreement with the epoxy content method. The activity of laccase-immobilized microspheres increased upon increasing the epoxy content. Furthermore, poly(GMA-co-nBA) microspheres revealed uniform size below 2 µm that contributes to large surface area of the microspheres to be used as a matrix, thus increasing the enzyme capacity and enzymatic reaction.

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic paints based on titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles represent a promising treatment technology for cleaning the air at our dwellings. A few studies have shown that instead of elimination of harmful indoor air pollutants the production of carbonyl compounds occurs from the photocatalytic paints. Herein, we report unexpectedly high concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released upon irradiation of photocatalytic paints which are meant to clean the air at our dwellings. The concentrations of the VOCs were measured continuously and online by PTR-ToF-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry) connected to a well-established flow tube photoreactor. The PTR-ToF-MS analysis revealed the presence of 52 ions in the mass range between 20 and 490 amu, among which 43 have been identified. In particular very high emission rates were estimated of two relevant indoor air pollutants, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde as 355 μg h-1 and 257 μg h-1 for 1 m2, respectively. We suggest a detailed reaction mechanism responsible for the production of these harmful indoor air pollutants (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, among the others). The hydroxyl radicals (OH) formed upon activation of TiO2, react with the organic constituent (butyl acrylate and vinyl acetate) of the paint binder lead to generation of an important number of organic compounds. We demonstrate that the TiO2 quantity and the organic content of the binder is of paramount importance with respect to the formation of VOCs, which should be considered for future optimization of this air remediation technology based on TiO2 nanoparticles.",

In this work, the emissive organometallic complex, [CuBr(PPh3)2(4‐methylpyridine)], is successfully, mechanically ground into a random copolymer built on 4‐(diphenylphosphino)styrene (DPVP) and n‐butyl acrylate (BA) monomers. The resultant hybrid materials successfully inherit the emissive centers, and are significantly reinforced by the copper complexes as chemical crosslinkers in the polymeric continuum. These organometallic polymers are also proved to have excellent vapoluminescent properties, exhibiting unique responses to many organic solvent vapors, reflecting their rapid loss and recovery of photoluminescence. Mechanically robust and flexible films prepared with these organometallic Cu(I)‐polymers are tested as recoverable sensors for hazardous volatile chemical compounds (VOCs) such as toluene, acetone, chloroform, and dichloromethane, and the low limits of detection (LOD) can reach as low as 1 × 10−3–8 × 10−3 mg L−1 (0.2–3.3 ppmV, parts per million‐volume) for various VOCs.

    "abstract": "The behavior of colloidal silicon dioxide in a composition with a styrene / butyl acrylate oligomer, grafted onto a thermoplastic polyamide adhesive to obtain a branched binder structure with penetration of branches into the capillary-pore system of the reinforcing fiber component, was studied. The variants of disaggregation of SiO2 using ultrasonic treatment and mechanical activation with exposure by high shear stresses, ultrasound and cavitation are compared. Methods of dynamic light scattering, IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and textile materials science were used to evaluate the elastic-deformation properties of duplicated packets. The set of complementary results confirms that the combined mechanical activation of an aqueous dispersion of oligoacrylate and silica causes the destruction of silica nanospheres and the formation of a hybrid oligolymer-inorganic adduct. In contrast to the short-term effects of ultrasonic dispersion of SiO2, joint mechanical activation of the components solves the problems of preventing aggregation of nanoparticles and uniform distribution of the reinforcing filler in the composite. The effectiveness of using the method for regulating the properties of forming units and parts of sewing products is shown. When selecting oligoacrylate, specific for sewing production separation of the stages of preliminary bonding of materials using thermoplastic adhesive, the creation of a finished product form and its fixing during wet-heat treatment, is taken into account. The preparation of a hybrid adduct of mechanical activation provides an optimal ratio of particle size for rational distribution of fractions in interfacial, interfiber, and intrafiber spaces of the textile web. The shift of the peaks of phase transitions and chemical transformations in a system with nanodispersed SiO2, controlled on DSC thermograms, is consistent with the temperature regimes of successive stages of the technological process.

    "abstract": "Dot gain is called Tone Value Increase (TVI). Low dot gain and rounder dot shape are important properties to obtain a good print. Dot gain is a measure of how much extra weight a given percent dot or tone has gained on the final printed substrate by comparison to the actual dot area on a press plate. Dot gain value depends on many factors. The interactions of paper, ink and press conditions are important determinates for a good print. In addition, the pigment coating process and calendering conditions have a significant effect on the printability of paperboards. Pigment coating formulations including mineral pigments, binders and additives improve the gloss, brightness, opacity and smoothness of the paperboards. As a result, print quality of paperboards increase. A uniform paperboard surface is needed to obtain a high quality surface smoothness after the coating process. High surface smoothness improves the uniformity of the dot shape and size. Pigment coating formulation parameters; pigment selection, binder selection and binder level influence print quality. The aims of this study - pigment selection and ratio - are to determine the effect on dot gain in lithography printing. To this aim, base paperboards were coated using five pigment coating formulations which included different combinations of kaolin, calcium carbonate and titanium dioxide pigment with a styrene\\n-butyl acrylate copolymer binder using a bar application. After coating, the samples were air-dried overnight under TAPPI conditions. Then, half of the coated-paperboards were calendered. Tone scales from 1 to 100 % were offset printed using black ink on the uncalendered and calenderedcoated paperboards. Then, from the printed tone scale, the tone area values were measured with the Gretagmacbeth Spectrolino spectrophotometer. These values showed that pigment coating improved the surface optical and physical properties of paperboards. After calendering, the roughness values of coated paperboards decreased. In addition, the obtained dot and line sharpness on calendered-coated paperboards were better than on uncalenderedcoated paperboards. However, the dot gain values of calendered-coated paperboards had fewer dot gains than uncalendered-coated paperboards. It was established that the variation of pigment proportions in the coating formulations had no significant effect on dot gain.",

This study proposes a toughening method for poly(methyl methacrylate) resin used in liquid molding by copolymerizing it with butyl acrylate (BA) and butyl methacrylate (BMA) monomers. The effects of BA or BMA on the polymerization reaction and mechanical properties were investigated, with a focus on improving toughness. Dynamic thermal analysis (DSC) and 13C NMR spectroscopy confirmed the formation of copolymers and the incorporation of BA or BMA monomers. The introduction of BA or BMA lowered the glass transition temperature but had minimal impact on the polymerization rate, with only a slight increase in polymerization time (14.77‰ and 4.320‰ for 8% BA or BMA, respectively). Adding small amounts of BA or BMA significantly enhanced the toughness of the resin. When the content reached 4%, elongation at break increased by 103% and 139%, and impact strength improved by 222% and 328%. These results shift the failure mode from brittle to ductile fracture, paving the way for the industrial application of high‐performance in situ polymerized poly(methyl methacrylate) resin.",

In this paper, the LDPE matrix was modified by three types of ethylene-butyl acrylate (EBA) copolymers (1.0 wt%) with different polarities (BA content) via melt blending to optimize the space charge behavior of the LDPE insulation. The micromorphology and structure of the blends are examined by polarized light microscope and differential scanning calorimetry. The space charge distribution is tested by the pulsed electro-acoustic method. The trap level is studied by the thermally stimulated current. The results show that EBA introduces more deep traps and decreases the shallow traps. The medium-polar EBA (16% BA content) can effectively suppress charge accumulation, and have the same suppressed effect on XLPE/EBA blends.

The one-step sandwich hybridization recognition involved a pair of a DNA probe, i.e., capture probe (pDNA), and AuNP–PSA reporter label that flanked the target DNA (complementary DNA (cDNA)). The concentration of dengue virus cDNA was optically transduced by immobilized AuNP–PSA–rDNA conjugates as the DNA micro-optode exhibited a violet hue upon the DNA sandwich hybridization reaction, which could be monitored by a fiber-optic reflectance spectrophotometer at 637 nm.

    "abstract": "Abstract. One of the most progressive methods of treatment of gastroduodenal bleeding in peptic ulcers of the stomach and duodenum is endoscopic hemostasis (EH), which is relatively safe and highly effective. Endoscopic hemostasis in gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding is achieved in more than 90% of cases. This procedure is recommended for bleeding caused by peptic ulcers of the stomach and duodenum, as a first-line method with relatively high efficiency and a small number of complications, but it is inferior to surgical methods in terms of the number of recurrences of bleeding. \nThe aim: analysis of EH results in patients with gastroduodenal bleeding against the background of comorbid diabetes. \nMaterials and methods. 834 patients with gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding were under observation. The average age of the patients was (51.4±0.54) years, duration of disease manifestation – (5.3±0.28) years, duration of bleeding – (46.3±1.49) hours, diameter and volume of gastric ulcer – (1.3±0.05) mm and (510.4±47.13) mm3, and duodenal ulcers — (0.8±0.01) mm and (164.5±7.34) mm3, the value of the ulcer severity index (WI) — (5.9±0,07) c. u., bleeding severity index (BI) – (2.1±0.03) points, average blood pressure parameters – (98.8±0.66) mmHg, glycemia indicators (Gl) – (10.0±0.26) mmol/l, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1/c) – (8.2±0.20)%, insulin (Ins) – (24.9±1.36) μIU/ml, coefficient of the degree of insulin resistance (NOMA) – (11.8±0.81) in. at. The ratio of mild, moderate and severe type 2 diabetes was 1:2:1. EH was performed on 283 (97.9%) patients on the background of hemostatic drug therapy, who were the main observation group. The comparison group included 551 patients who received only similar medical treatment. EH was performed in 92.2% of cases with the injection of a 0.9% solution of sodium chloride, adrenaline, alcohol-novocaine mixture, clipping, coagulation, and in 7.8% with the use of N-butyl-2 spraying in the edges of the ulcer - acrylate. \nThe results. Within 1 month after carrying out endoscopic and drug hemostasis, recurrence of gastroduodenal bleeding was detected in 12.9% of cases, and half as often with EH (respectively in 7.9% and 15.9% of observations in the main group and the comparison group χ 2 =11, 58, p=0.001). The effectiveness of the use of EH is higher compared to separate isolated hemostatic therapy, as evidenced by the 60-hour survival rates in the main group (cumulative proportion 0.98) and in the comparison group (cumulative proportion 0.91). It should be noted that comorbid diabetes reduces the survival of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding during these observation periods.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The synthesis of copolymers of butyl acrylate with vinyl isobutyl ether was carried out by adding the active monomer to the excess of the comonomer when boiling in the presence of triethylborane. An organoelement co-initiator was isolated from a complex with hexamethylenediamine in a solution of vinyl butyl ether, with addition of methacrylic acid in an the of butyl acrylate with a macromolecular chain is along two oligomeric and low-molecular. The formation of an oligomer along with a low-molecular usually formed under at traditional radical initiation, is explained by the presence of radicals in the reaction mixture, which are known in the oxidation of trialkylboranes. Due to the interaction of the latter with initiating R• or RO• radicals, which are also observed during the oxidation of trialkylboranes, or with oligomeric growing radicals, a growth center of the polymer chain is formed by the mechanism of reversible inhibition with a very low degree of polymerization. Continued thermostating of the reaction mixture after dosing butyl acrylate with methacrylic acid leads to a shift in the oligomeric mode in the direction of increasing the value of molecular weight; accordingly, M n increases and M w /M n decreases. This occurs because the copolymerization process continues in the absence of the initiator due to the reversible inhibition reaction. The time-dependent conversion rate is characterized by an abrupt decrease in the conversion rate by 40–60 %, which is also associated with the transition of the method of forming macromolecules with the predominantly high-speed bimolecular break to a process following the reversible inhibition mechanism according to the scheme, which runs at a much lower rate. The composition of the copolymers is characterized by a slightly higher equimolar content of acrylate, with a higher value of the relative activity of vinyl isobutyl ether, paired with butyl acrylate during copolymerization (r BA = 1.45 ± 0.07; r VBE ≈ 0; r BA = 5.2 ± 1.5; r ViBE ≈ 0).",

Nanocomposite films of EVA and EBA were first produced by cast extrusion, with two types of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) differing in the aspect ratio used as nanofillers. Subsequently, the films were applied as a coating to the corresponding neat copolymer substrate, and the combustion behavior of the so-obtained samples was evaluated through cone calorimeter tests. Despite the small amount of nanofillers (0.5 wt.% considering the whole specimen), the application of the coatings significantly improved the time to ignition compared to the pristine copolymers, while the shape of the heat release rate curves and the relative peak values remained relatively unchanged. The effect of the embedded nanofillers in delaying the ignition was more effective for the EVA-based systems than for the EBA ones (showing an increment of 30% and 12%, respectively, compared to the uncoated samples), likely due to the more homogeneous dispersion of the LDHs obtained in the first case. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the coating approach, since it allows the flame-retardant action to be concentrated on the surface of a polymer system, where combustion specifically takes place, while minimizing the required amount of flame retardant.",

A new approach was developed to design advanced adhesives with high mechanical, adhesion, and thermal properties by adding hybrid additives. Based on the tensile test results, adding 5 phr of zirconium oxide nanoparticles to the epoxy adhesive increased the tensile strength, modulus, and the toughness of the dumbbell-shaped samples by 69, 33 and 175% compared to the neat epoxy adhesive, respectively. Furthermore, the sample containing 10 phr phenolic resin, 5 phr zirconia NPs, and 2.5 phr block copolymer exhibited the highest improvement (420%) in the shear strength in the single lap joint increment compared to pure epoxy, reflecting the synergistic impact of these compounds at the mentioned percentage. The TGA results indicated the highest initial degradation temperature in the sample containing 5 phr zirconia NPs which was 54.4 °C higher than that of the pure epoxy. The images of the fracture surface of the optimal samples in the tensile test showed the cavitation, shear band formation, crack deviation, and crack tip blunting as major mechanisms in the toughness enhancement of the samples.",

DAPP was blended with regular bisphenol A epoxy acrylate (BAEA) in various ratios to yield various phosphorus contents. The TGA-IR (thermogravimetric analyzer interface with an infrared spectrometer) results demonstrate that compounding 30 mol % DAPP with BAEA significantly reduced the amount of released CO gas. In contrast, the peak intensity of CO2 is independent of phosphorus content. The limiting oxygen index (LOI), reaching the saturated value of 26, and the heat release rate (HRR) measured using a cone-calorimeter, 156.43 KW/m2, confirm the saturation point when 30 mol % DAPP was compounded into BAEA. A study of the kinetics of pyrolysis reveals that Ea decreases as the phosphorus content increases. Both the TGA-IR and pyrolysis results reveal that the phosphorus compound DAPP is easily decomposed during the initial stage of burning to form an insulating layer, which inhibits further burning of the resin and the consequent release of other flammable gases.",

Here, we report the simple fabrication of BCP-based photonic nanocomposites with large differences in refractive index (Δn > 0.27). Zirconium oxide (ZrO2) nanoparticles coated with gallic acid are used to tune the optical constants of the target domains of self-assembled (polynorbornene-graft-poly(tert-butyl acrylate))-block-(polynorbornene-graft-poly(ethylene oxide)) (PtBA-b-PEO) brush block copolymers (BBCPs). Strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between the ligands on ZrO2 and PEO brushes of the BBCPs enable selective incorporation and high loading of up to 70 wt % (42 vol %) of the ZrO2 nanoparticles within the PEO domain, resulting in a significant increase of refractive index from 1.45 to up to 1.70. Consequently, greatly enhanced reflection at approximately 398 nm (increases of ∼250%) was observed for the photonic nanocomposites (domain spacing = 137 nm) relative to that of the unmodified BBCPs, which is consistent with numeric modeling results using transfer matrix methods. This work provides a simple strategy for a wide range tuning of optical constants of BCP domains, thereby enabling the design and creation of high-performance photonic coatings for various applications. The large refractive index contrast enables high reflectivity while simultaneously reducing the coating thickness necessary, compared to pure BCP systems.",

In this work we aimed at developing efficient tools for amplification‐free nucleic acid detection, which resulted in the synthesis of new fluorescent nanoparticles. Here, the fluorescent nanoparticles were made by simple and inexpensive radical emulsion polymerization of butyl acrylate in the presence of fluorescent dyes and additional functionalization reagents. This provided ultra‐bright macrofluorophores of 9–84 nm mean diameter, modified with additional alkyne and amino groups for bioconjugation. By using click and NHS chemistries, the new nanoparticles were attached to target‐specific DNA probes that were used in fluorimetry and fluorescence microscopy. Overall, these fluorescent nanoparticles and their oligonucleotide derivatives have higher photostability, brighter fluorescence and hence dramatically lower limits of target detection than the individual organic dyes. These properties make them useful in approaches directed towards ultrasensitive detection of nucleic acids, in particular for imaging and in vitro diagnostics of DNA.",

Nine SMP formulations containing varying amounts of tert-Butyl acrylate (tBA) and Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) were analyzed for endothelial cell attachment. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), contact angle studies, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to verify bulk and surface properties of the SMPs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) attachment and viability was verified using fluorescent methods. Endothelial cells preferentially attached to SMPs with higher tBA content, which have rougher, more hydrophobic surfaces.

    "abstract": "The current study focuses on the development of innovative and highly-stable curcumin (CUR)-based therapeutics by encapsulating CUR in biocompatible poly(n-butyl acrylate)-block-poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate) (PnBA-b-POEGA) micelles. State-of-the-art methods were used to investigate the encapsulation of CUR in PnBA-b-POEGA micelles and the potential of ultrasound to enhance the release of encapsulated CUR. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopies confirmed the successful encapsulation of CUR within the hydrophobic domains of the copolymers, resulting in the formation of distinct and robust drug/polymer nanostructures. The exceptional stability of the CUR-loaded PnBA-b-POEGA nanocarriers over a period of 210 days was also demonstrated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy studies. A comprehensive 2D NMR characterization of the CUR-loaded nanocarriers authenticated the presence of CUR within the micelles, and unveiled the intricate nature of the drug-polymer intermolecular interactions. The UV-Vis results also indicated high encapsulation efficiency values for the CUR-loaded nanocarriers and revealed a significant influence of ultrasound on the release profile of CUR. The present research provides new understanding of the encapsulation and release mechanisms of CUR within biocompatible diblock copolymers and has significant implications for the advancement of safe and effective CUR-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Acrylate emulsion is widely used in various industrial fields and is an important polymer emulsion. However, the high flammability limits its application. Besides, acrylate emulsion generally releases a large amount of smoke during combustion. To improve the fire resistance and smoke suppression properties of acrylate emulsions, methyl methacrylate‐butyl acrylate copolymer P(MMA‐BA)/DOPO‐based polymerizable monomer (HEPO)/zinc molybdate sepiolite (Mo‐Sep) composite emulsion was prepared by emulsion polymerization, and the effect of Mo‐Sep content on the flame‐retardant performance, thermal stability, and smoke suppression performance of the composite emulsion was studied. Through microcalorimeter and smoke density meter tests, it was found that the heat release rate (HRR) of the composite emulsion, added with 30% HEPO/3% Mo‐Sep, was reduced by 63.3%, and the peak heat release rate (PHRR) was reduced by 72.1%. The total heat release (THR) is reduced by 49.0%, while the peak‐specific optical density is reduced by 48.0%. It shows that the composite emulsion has excellent flame‐retardant and smoke suppression properties compared to pure MAA‐BA emulsion.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The uses of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are wide ranging, with applications including labels, tapes, and graphics. To achieve good adhesion, a PSA must exhibit a balance of viscous and elastic properties. Previous research has found that a thin, elastic surface layer on top of a softer, dissipative layer resulted in greater tack adhesion compared with the single layers. Superior properties were achieved through a bilayer obtained via successive depositions, which consume energy and time. To achieve a multilayered structure via a single deposition process, we have stratified mixtures of waterborne colloidal polymer particles with two different sizes: large poly(acrylate) adhesive particles (ca. 660 nm in diameter) and small poly(butyl acrylate) (pBA) particles (ca. 100 nm). We used two types of pBA within the particles: either viscoelastic pBA without an added cross-linker or elastic pBA with a fully cross-linked network. Stratified surface layers of deuterium-labeled pBA particles with thicknesses of at least 1 μm were found via elastic recoil detection and qualitatively verified via the analysis of surface topography. The extent of stratification increased with the evaporation rate; films that were dried slowest exhibited no stratification. This result is consistent with a model of diffusiophoresis. When the elastic, cross-linked pBA particles were stratified at the surface, the tack adhesion properties made a transition from brittle failure to tacky. For pBA without an added cross-linker, all adhesives showed fibrillation during debonding, but the extent of fibrillation increased when the films were stratified. These results demonstrate that the PSA structure can be controlled through the processing conditions to achieve enhanced properties. This research will aid the future development of layered or graded single-deposition PSAs with designed adhesive properties.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "During the utilization of silicone rubber, excessive friction can cause damage to the contact surface and the material itself. Therefore, friction‐reducing modification of silicone rubber has attracted much attention. In this paper, hyperbranched polysiloxanes with different structures is synthesized for friction‐reducing modification of silicone rubber. Infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and amine titration tests reveal that hyperbranched polysiloxanes are successfully synthesized by the hydrolytic condensation of 3‐aminopropyltriethoxysilane and their Michael addition with four acrylates with different alkyl chains. The friction coefficients and mechanical properties of silicone rubber are evaluated. Hyperbranched polysiloxanes significantly reduces friction and maintained excellent mechanical properties of silicone rubber. Silicone rubber with butyl‐ester‐secondary‐amino hyperbranched polysiloxane displays the best overall performance, with static and dynamic friction coefficients decreasing by 33.99% and 43.16% compared with that of pure silicone rubber, respectively, and a tensile strength of 10.80 MPa. The friction‐reducing mechanism of hyperbranched polysiloxanes on silicone rubber is investigated by contact angle test and dynamic mechanical analysis. Hyperbranched polysiloxanes migrates to the surface due to the incompatibility of alkyl chains with silicone rubber matrix. Consequently, the shielding effect produced by hyperbranched polysiloxanes on the surface depresses the adsorption activity of silicone rubber surface thereby reducing friction.This article is protected by copyright.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTPolysilsesquioxane–fluoroacrylate copolymer [poly(methyl methacrylate)–butyl acrylate–dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate)] (FPSQ) composite latex particles with a trilayer core–shell morphology were manufactured by seeded emulsion polymerization, where PSQ latex particles bearing reactive methacryloxypropyl moieties were first produced by the hydrolysis‐condensation of (3‐methacryloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane, and then they were utilized as seeds, with methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, and dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate as the inner and outer shell monomers. Fourier‐transform infrared spectra and 1H‐NMR confirm the structure of the FPSQs. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy demonstrate that the obtained composite emulsion particles emerge with the trilayer core–shell pattern. Due to the anchoring of PSQ nanoparticles, the thermal stabilities of the FPSQ films are strengthened, and the resistance to heat is gradually improved along with the increase of the fluoroacrylate dose in the polymer matrix composite. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and hydrophobicity investigations indicate that the fluorinated chain segments tend to concentrate at the film–air two‐phase interface. In addition, the AFM result denotes that importing more fluorine into the FPSQ hybrid material will engender greater phase separation and enrichment of the fluoroalkyl segments and a rougher morphology.

The difference in thermal and swelling properties among the HCPs, RCPs, and covalently cross-linked polymers (CCPs) was small, whereas the coexistence of a small amount of CCs in the HCPs severely reduced the fracture energy of the resulting polymers relative to that of the RCP, thus suggesting a suitable protocol for the molecular design of tough...",

Five latexes with different glass transition temperatures were prepared by changing the soft monomer (butyl acrylate) content. The diameter of the polymer particles in colloidal solution was studied by dynamic light scattering and the diameter of the polymer particles adsorbed on cement was observed by environmental scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the diameters of polymer particles adsorbed on cement were larger than those in colloidal solution, especially for polymer particles with a high content of soft monomer. The ‘real coverage area’ of polymer particles on cement was theoretically calculated according to the number average diameter of polymer particles adsorbed on cement. It was found that, instead of the adsorption amount of polymer on cement, the real coverage area of polymer on cement is positively correlated with the setting time of latex-modified cement paste. A higher content of soft monomer led to easier deformation of the polymer particles adsorbed on cement, so that the retardation effect of latex on the early hydration of cement increased.",

After building an ARIMA model for the price and comparing its prediction with the actual value, it was clearly found the price of chemicals dropped severely because of the pandemic, and conclusion is made that the in-depth reason was the sharp drop of demands in downstream industry, which is also appropriate for most chemicals, especially those related to petrochemical industry. The study highlights its detailed research on the factors related to price fluctuation and the use of ARIMA model for simulating the price under the hypothetical situation with no pandemic happening, which is a new method for researches on chemical industry researches, and it provides subsequent researchers with a more effective perspective comparing with traditional chemical researches using quantitative experiment and comparison.

In this work, a combination of graphene oxide (GO) and functionalized waterborne polymer particles was investigated, as versatile and promising candidates for CO2 capture application, with the aim to develop an easily scalable, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly CO2 capture technology. There are huge possibilities of different functional monomers that can be selected to functionalize the polymer particles and to provide CO2-philicity to the composite nanostructures. Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to gain a deeper understanding of the interactions of these complex composite materials with CO2 and N2 molecules, and to build a basis for efficient screening for functional monomers. Estimation of the binding energy between CO2 and a set of GO/polymer composites, comprising copolymers of methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, and different functional monomers, shows that it depends strongly on the polymer functionalities. In some cases, there is a lack of cooperative effect of GO. It is explained by a remarkably strong GO-polymer binding, which induced less effective CO2-polymer interactions. When compared with experimental results, in the cases when the nanocomposite structures presented similar textural properties, the same trends for selective CO2 capture over N2 were attained. Besides novel functional materials for CO2 capture and a deeper understanding of the interactions between CO2 molecules with various materials, this study additionally demonstrates that DFT calculations can be a shorter route toward the efficient selection of the best functionalization of the composite materials for selective CO2 capture.",

It is based on a strategy of contrast/edge enhancement, locally adaptive to image data in digital images of materials. The method allows to binarize straightforwardly the structures (the phases) in TEM and SEM images after edge identification, edge choice, and image virtual reconstruction. A detailed insight is brought into one‐step batch supercritical CO2 foaming of acrylic amorphous PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) polymers, aided by the nanostructuration of block copolymers (BCP), here MAM (butyl acrylate center block methyl acrylate side blocks). The foaming conditions, i.e., pressure drop rate (PDR) and saturation temperature required for an actual one‐step procedure are specified and clarified, whereas previous works, dealing with “one‐step procedures”, are probably incurring in a two‐step procedure. The roles of the BCP content (and size) and saturation temperature are carefully analyzed and further clarified, more comprehensively than in previous literature. Thanks to the analysis of size distributions of foams and foam blend precursors (0.25, 0.5, 10 wt% MAM), bi modality of 10 wt% foams is for example revealed. A discussion of kinetics effects, i.e., evolutions of the effective sample temperature Tef (t), and the effective glass transition temperature T g, ef (t). provides a new insight of “pseudo” one‐step VS “real” one‐step batch foaming.",

The utilization of this CTA in the Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) process reveals an efficient control in the polymerization of methacrylic monomers and the preparation of block copolymers. The latter are obtained by the (co)polymerization of styrene or butyl acrylate using a functionalized macro-CTA polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) previously synthesized. Data show low molecular weight dispersity values (Đ < 1.5) particularly in the polymerization of methacrylic monomers. Considering a typical RAFT mechanism, the leaving groups (R) from the fragmentation of CTA should be able to re-initiate the polymerization (formation of growth chains) allowing an efficient control of the process. Nevertheless, in the case of the polymerization of MMA in the presence of this symmetrical CTA, the polymerization process displays an atypical behavior that requires high [initiator]/[CTA] molar ratios for accessing predictable molecular weights without affecting the Đ. Some evidence suggests that this does not completely behave as a common RAFT agent as it is not completely consumed during the polymerization reaction, and it needs atypical high molar ratios [initiator]/[CTA] to be closer to the predicted molecular weight without affecting the Đ. This work demonstrates that MMA and other methacrylic monomers can be polymerized in a controlled way, and with “living” characteristics, using certain symmetrical trithiocarbonates.",

    "abstract": "\n Polymer flooding is a mature enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology that has seen increasing interest over the past decade. Copolymers of acrylamide (AMD) and acrylic acid (AA) have been the most prominent chemicals to be applied, whereas sulfonated polymers containing 2-acrylamido-tertiary-butyl sulfonic acid (ATBS) have been used for higher temperature and/or salinity conditions. The objective of this study was to generate guidelines to aid in the selection of appropriate polyacrylamide chemistry for each field case. Our focus was in sandstone fields operating at the upper end of AA-AMD temperature tolerance, where there is a decision as to whether sulfonation is required. The performance of the polymer throughout the whole residence time in the reservoir was considered because the macromolecule can undergo some changes over this period.\n Several key properties of nine distinct polymer species were investigated. The polymers consisted of AA-AMD copolymers, AMD-ATBS copolymers, and AMD-AA-ATBS terpolymers (up to 15 mol% ATBS). The polymer solutions were studied both in their original state as they would be during the injection (initial viscosity, initial adsorption, and in-situ rheology), as well as in the state in which they are expected to be after the polymer has aged in the reservoir (i.e., in a different state of hydrolysis with corresponding changes in viscosity retention and adsorption after aging for various time periods). We note that the combination of viscosity retention and adsorption during the in-situ aging process has not been typically investigated in previous literature, and this is a key novel feature of this work. Each of the above parameters has an impact on the effectiveness and the economic efficiency of a polymer flooding project.\n The majority of the work was carried out in seawater (SW) at a temperature of 58°C. Under these conditions, AMD-AA samples showed similar solution viscosity at 5 to 30% AA. When the AA-AMD polymer solutions were aged at elevated temperature, the AA content steadily increased because of hydrolysis reactions. When the AA content was 30 mol% or higher, the viscosity started to decrease, and the adsorption started to increase as the polymer solution was aged further. Thermal stability improved when ATBS was included in the polymer structure. In addition, sulfonated polyacrylamide samples showed constant initial viscosity yields and decreasing initial adsorption with increasing ATBS content. The samples showed that the maximum observed apparent in-situ viscosity increased when the bulk viscosity and relaxation time of the solution increased. The information generated in this study can be used to aid in the selection of the most optimal polyacrylamide chemistry, which may not necessarily be the standard 30% AA and 70% AMD copolymer, for sandstone fields operating with moderate/high salinity brines at the upper end of AA-AMD temperature tolerance.",

The BaTiO3-P tBA nanoparticles are introduced into poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix to form a BaTiO3-P tBA/PVDF nanocomposite. The nanocomposites keep the flexibility of the PVDF matrix with enhanced dielectric constant (∼15@100 Hz) because of the high permittivity of inorganic particles and the ester functional groups in the P tBA. Furthermore, the BaTiO3-P tBA/PVDF nanocomposites demonstrate the inherent small dielectric loss of the PVDF matrix in the tested frequency range. The high electric field dielectric constant of the nanocomposite film was investigated by polarization hysteresis loops. The high electric field effective dielectric constant of the nanocomposite is 26.5 at 150 MV/m.

An attempt was also made to use EVA as a polymer chain brancher. The molecular structure of the components and their compositions, rheology, curing kinetics, and phase organization of photocured systems were studied using FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, spectrophotometry, rheometry, Photo-DSC, and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that heat treatment of EVA allows the formation of single C=C bonds in macromolecules, which are necessary for a potential crosslinking agent with tBA. It was shown that EVA effectively functions as a thickener and modifier: with an increase in the modifier concentration, the nature of the composition flow changes from Newtonian to pseudoplastic, the rate of the photochemical polymerization reaction decreases, and the degree of conversion of the system decreases. However, the formation of a heterogeneous phase structure and the absence of a continuous spatial network of chemical bonds prevent the use of EVA simultaneously as a functional additive and crosslinking agent.",

It is found that the development law of storage modulus and lag angle of the PMhcp during temperature rise is highly correlated with glass-rubber transition of polymer phase, indicating the dynamic mechanical properties of PMhcp are dominated by the polymer phase. Inherent parameters of polymer including Tg and functional groups greatly influence damping performance of PMhcp. PMhcp containing polymers with lower Tg and highly carboxylated colloidal surface displays higher damping ability. In addition, a subsequent heat treatment further enhances the damping performance of PMhcp.

The results confirmed the synthesis of BA-co – PEGDMA copolymers by the identification of characteristic FTIR bands and which determined the glass transition temperature of the copolymers. The conversions were found in the range of 85% to 90%. Within the stability of the produced latex, it was observed that at 10% and 30% wt. of PEGDMA the systems were stable, but when more PEGDMA was added up 40% to 50% wt., the system became unstable. The stability of produced latexes depends on the PEGDMA contents and this must be less than 30% wt.; meanwhile the PEGDMA content greater than 30% wt. leads to unstable latexes, forming clots.

    "abstract": "Acrylic acid (AA) is a versatile monomer whose high reactivity can present a challenge for transport and storage due to its highly exergonic oligomerization, which can lead to runaway polymerization and explosion. To prevent premature polymerization of acrylic acid, hydroquinone monomethyl ether (MeHQ) and phenothiazine (PTZ) are commonly used as inhibitors/stabilizers. Despite their widespread use, the limited radical-trapping stoichiometry of MeHQ and oxidative consumption of PTZ at process temperatures are clear limitations. Herein, we apply a recently devised spectrophotometric approach employing the autoxidizable STY-BODIPY dye to monitor reaction progress in autoxidations of acrylic acid, n-butyl acrylate and the non-polymerizable 2-ethylhexanol, and the impact of a panel of radical-trapping antioxidants (RTAs, including MeHQ and PTZ) upon them. We find that the radical-trapping stoichiometry is highly substrate-dependent, with nitroxides and aromatic amines that can be converted to nitroxides in situ exhibiting superstoichiometric activities in substrates where hydroperoxyl radicals are formed or in the presence of acid. N-Alkyl derivatives of phenoxazine, the most potent RTA uncovered to date, are found to be particularly excellent inhibitors of AA autoxidation. It is proposed that gradual acid-mediated dealkylation to phenoxazine minimizes accumulation of the phenoxazine-derived nitroxide, which can otherwise undergo acid-catalyzed disproportionation and diminish radical-trapping capacity. These results suggest that N-alkylated phenoxazine derivatives should be explored further as stabilizers of AA.",

The gel consists for more than 99% of γ-ray-polymerized (~15% conversion) tertiary-butyl acrylate (TBA) containing ~100 ppm of a fluorogenic compound, e.g., maleimido-pyrene (MPy). The radio-fluorogenic effect depends on copolymerization of the MPy into growing chains of TBA on radiation-induced polymerization. This converts the maleimido residue, which quenches the pyrene fluorescence, into a succinimido moeity (SPy), which does not. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the yield of free-radicals formed and hence to the local dose deposited.

    "doi": "10.2118/199324-ms",
    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "\n Challenges of water shut-off, which is categorized under conformance control, are nowadays common in the oil and gas industry. The excessive water quantities produced from oil reservoirs can make the production process economically infeasible. The target of water shut-off process is plugging fractures or high permeability zones to decrease water cuts. Polyacrylamide tert-butyle Acrylate (PAtBA) is used for such applications. Silica (silicon dioxide) has been found to have a strengthening effect as well as it enhances the thermal and mechanical stability of the system. The objective of this study is to introduce nanosilica to reinforce PAtBA crosslinked by polyethyleneimine (PEI) and chromium Acetate (CrAc3) for low and high temperature conformance control applications. In this study, different ratios of polymer to crosslinker were investigated to choose the optimum combination. Then, nanosilica (NS) with different sizes (20, 50 and 85 nm) was added to the polymeric formulation with the inorganic crosslinker (CrAc3) to study the effect of silica content and size on gel strength. While, the reinforcement of the organically crosslinked gels with PEI was accomplished at 130°C. Evaluation of different systems was based on testing the rheological behavior of the mature gel based on the final storage modulus (G′). Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) technique was also employed to understand the nature of chemical interaction between the various chemicals. The investigation reveals that PatBA:CrAc3 of 9:0.5 is the optimum ratio producing the most strong gel. Silica with the size of 20 nm has produced the strongest gel by increasing the storage modulus by more than 150 %. At high temperature (130°C), 50 nm silica with PAtBA/PEI showed the highest storage modules compared to other sizes. DSC investigation discloses that silica is an inert and has no effect on the gelation reactions. Thus, silica has physical interactions with the polymer in the form of hydrogen bonding which enhances the strength of the gel in comparison with silica-free gels. Therefore, this study introduces a new polymeric formulation that serves as a water shut-off agent for reservoirs at low and high temperatures. The formulation that consists of PAtBA, CrAc3 and NS makes the system more stable and gives it more resistivity toward high shears. Whereas higher gel strength was achieved when PAtBA/PEI/NS was used at high temperatures.",

The focus of this work is to develop a polymer hybrid latex by emulsion and miniemulsion copolymerization of styrene with n‐butyl acrylate and methacrylic acid in the presence of different concentrations of KL furnished by the pulp and paper industry. The study intends to substitute a styrene in the system to understand the effect of non‐modified KL on the properties not only of the latexes, but also on the copolymers themselves. Each polymerization was carried out by shot‐process of tertbutyl hydroperoxide and sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate as the redox system. The polymer latexes were characterized in relation to overall conversion, particle diameter, particle morphology, coagulum formation, surface tension, zeta potential, and atomic force microscopy. The polymers were evaluated through gel permeation chromatography, water absorption, and thermal properties. The results show that the addition of non‐modified KL results in inhibition of the polymerization and that KL acts as a colloid stabilizer. Small particles were generated in the initial stages of the polymerizations. The presence of the KL altered the color of the latexes; the increase in KL concentration resulted in increase in the absorption of water of the polymer films; the increase in KL concentration resulted in decrease of the molar mass of the copolymers.",

We present a mild, facile method to cleave tert-butyl groups from poly(tert-butyl acrylate) blocks that yields poly(acrylic acid) (pAA) blocks free of traces of the ester. The reaction utilizes a slight excess of HCl in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) at room temperature and runs to completion within 4 h. We compare deprotection in HFIP with the common TFA/DCM method and show that the latter does not yield clean pAA. We show the effect of complete tert-butyl cleavage on a ABA triblock copolymer, where poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) is A and pAA is B, by means of viscosimetry, DLS, and SAXS on solutions above overlap. The pNIPAM blocks dehydrate, and their increased self-affinity above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) results in network formation by the triblocks. This manifests itself as an increase in viscosity and a slowing down of the first-order correlation function in light scattering. However, this stickering effect manifests itself exclusively when the pAA block is tert-butyl-free. Additionally, SAXS shows that the conformational properties of tert-butyl-free pAA copolymers are markedly different from those with residual esters. Thus, we illustrate a surprising effect of hydrophobic impurities that act across blocks and assert the usefulness of HCl/HFIP in pAA synthesis.",

The composite emulsifiers were composed of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and alkylphenol polyoxyethylene ether (OP-10). In this study, we successfully fabricated polyacrylate (PA). The morphology of the latex particles was spherical, with a diameter of ∼200 nm. With the increase of BA content, the glass transition temperature (T g ) of PA decreased. The PA curing agent could significantly improve the soil’s mechanical property and water resistance. The compressive strength of PA-1 solidified soil increased to 2.67 MPa, which 187 % higher than the pure soil sample (PA-0). Meanwhile, PA-1 solidified soil would not break down after being immersed in water for 30 days.

However, Li is a highly reactive metal that grows dendrites during the cycling of lithium-metal batteries (LMBs). To resolve the problem, we developed a new non-flammable elastic quasi-solid electrolyte (QSE), which can be polymerized in situ and whose composition is tailored to achieve high elasticity. Moreover, the incorporation of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) renders the electrolyte non-flammable. Thanks to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed, the LMB with QSE displays excellent cycling stability as it can be operated for 500 cycles, with a capacity retention of 94%.

    "abstract": "Living organisms such as bacteria are able to grow, respond to stimuli, and divide as part of their life cycle. Designing smart three-dimensional (3D) materials that are able to perform such feats, i.e., continue on-demand growth and respond to external stimuli, is always a challenge for polymer and material scientists. At present, Johnson and co-workers have made a significant step forward in this field by the design of an approach capable of growing and replicating gels. Current photomediated additive manufacturing, a commonly used technique for 3D printing, relies on free radical polymerization techniques via layer-by-layer addition or continuous solid−liquid interface production of polymers. Both techniques result in the formation of “dead polymers” which are unable to be further chain extended to introduce new functionalities in a living manner. Johnson and co-workers engineered an alternative approach where a 3D “parent” gel is able to grow, respond to stimuli, and even generate a “daughter” gel that mimics or has completely diversified chemical and mechanical properties using visible light. In this light-mediated approach for additive manufacturing, a “living parent” gel is first fabricated, and the subsequential addition of functional monomers/cross-linkers is used to grow next generation of “daughter” gels with exceptional spatiotemporal control through photocatalysis, a field that recently has been gaining momentum. In their previous work, Johnson and co-workers reported on the use of the photoredox catalyst 10-phenylphenothiazine (PTH) to mediate solution polymerization of acrylate and acrylamide. In the current work, photoredox catalyzed growth (PRCG) of uniform polymer gels is first designed by forming a network of homogeneous polymers via strain promoted alkyne−azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) of a four-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) star polymer with dibenzocyclooctyne (Tetra-DBCO-PEG) and a bis-azide trthiocarbonate (bis-N3-TTC) in the presence of monomer, PTH, and/or cross-linker. Under blue light irradiation, PTH activates photo-RAFT polymerization, which results in monomer insertions to expand the network strands. In contrast to conventional photo controlled/living radical polymerization, which employs a photoinitiator, Johnson’s approach employs a photocatalyst which regulates the RAFT polymerization, via a reversible photoinduced electron transfer between the RAFT and photocatalysts known as photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization. The ability to reversibly activate and deactivate confers remarkable living properties to the polymers, and therefore to the gels. The novelty of this approach stems from the fact that chemically and mechanically differentiated or similar daughter gels can be derived from a single parent gel by manipulating parameters such as the polymer chain length, cross-linking density, and composition of the polymer network. For instance, a softer or stiffer daughter gel in comparison to the parent gel can be made by adding or removing cross-linkers. In addition, by maintaining constant cross-linking densities, daughter gels with different compositions are found to have similar mechanical properties. By using monomers such as N-isopropylacrylamide, n-butyl acrylate, and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate, thermal as well as polarity responsiveness can be introduced in the daughter gels. The daughter gels are able to self-heal after damage with improved mechanical properties. Daughter gels of similar and different compositions can be welded together to form complex gel progeny with spatially different compositions (Figure 1).",

The surface of the neat BT, BT-PBA and BT-PMMA nanoparticles was investigated using BET analysis and using contact angle. The nanoparticles were mixed with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) using micro compounder. The compatibility of the nanoparticles and PVDF matrix was evaluated investigation of the viscoelastic properties using dynamic mechanical analyzer. The contribution of the enhanced compatibility between the nanofiller and matrix was elucidated by electrical response to vibration testing.

    "abstract": "\n \n Photoresists (PRs) are light‐sensitive polymers used in photolithography to fabricate micropatterns on substrates. This study proposes a microphase separation strategy to overcome the flexibility limitations associated with typical acrylic‐based PRs in patterning applications by incorporating poly(ε‐caprolactone)‐\n b\n ‐poly(n‐butyl acrylate) (PCL‐\n b\n ‐PnBA) block copolymer (BCP) additives. A BCP additive was prepared using a dual‐functional initiator, ethyl 2‐hydroxyethyl‐2‐bromoisobutyrate (HEBiB), which can efficiently combine two eco‐friendly polymerization techniques of ring‐opening polymerization (ROP) and supplemental activator and reducing agent atom transfer radical polymerization (SARA ATRP) (i.e., ROP‐\n Є\n ‐SARA ATRP), allowing for precise control over compositions and compatibility. For synthesizing the PRs, methyl methacrylate (MMA), acrylic acid (AA), and maleic anhydride (MAn) monomers were utilized to afford two randomly copolymerized pre‐polymers, namely, P(MMA‐\n r\n ‐AA) and P(MMA‐\n r\n ‐MAn). Following esterification with allyl bromide and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), two PR systems (abbreviated as PMAV and PMMAnMA, respectively) were prepared.

Their photopatterning and mechanical properties were improved, owing to the occurrence of microphase separation within the matrix. Microstructure‐containing matrices were characterized by small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS). The compatibility of the BCP additive with commercially available polyimide acrylate (PIA) and polyurethane acrylate (PUA) PRs was examined. Lithographic evaluations showed improved resolution, uniformity, and developer resistance, highlighting the potential of PCL‐\n b\n ‐PnBA‐modified resins for high‐performance photoresists in flexible electronic fabrications and next‐generation lithography.\n",

A combination of ESR and atom transfer radical polymerization ( ATRP ) provided signi ﬁ cant new information on the properties of radicals in radical polymerization, e.g. dependency of chain length, dynamics, and reactivity ( hydrogen transfer ) of propagating radicals.

To overcome this di ﬃ culty radical precursors of oligo - and poly ( meth ) acrylates were prepared by ATRP and puri ﬁ ed.

The simulations in the condensed phase are performed through a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach. The free energy landscape associated with the reactive events under vacuum and in the condensed phase is used to correct harmonic transition state theory (TST) rate constants. The Arrhenius parameters so determined are introduced in a semi-detailed mechanistic kinetic mechanism of butyl acrylate polymerization in bulk and in solution, allowing it to test how the butyl acrylate polymerization rate is affected by solvent-induced cage effects on backbiting. The results show that the backbiting rate constant is higher in the condensed phase than in the gas phase. In addition, a twofold increase is observed in xylene compared to the bulk. These results differ significantly from previous theoretical calculations, especially at high temperatures, aligning better with experimental rate measurements. The semi-detailed model, incorporating our calculated rate coefficients, is validated against monomer concentration profiles from bulk and solution polymerizations in various reactor configurations, demonstrating good agreement with experimental data.

The results of dissolution experiments show that MAM has good compatibility with epoxy resin under certain conditions. FT-IR and DSC analyses show that adding MAM to epoxy hinders the curing reaction of epoxy resin, without participating in the curing reaction and changing the curing mechanism. The mechanical properties indicated by KIC and impact strength with an MAM content of 10 phr for the toughened system increase by 91.5% and 83.5%, respectively, compared to the situation without MAM, which may ascribed to the nanoparticles formed during the process of MAM/epoxy blending. In the curing process of an epoxy resin, the typical phase structure that occurs through the self-assembly process can be clearly observed in the MAM/epoxy blends.

Importantly, 99% of the incoming radiation is absorbed by the material, significantly increasing its applicability.

    "abstract": "Polymer micelles are promising drug delivery systems for highly hydrophobic photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications. We previously developed pH-responsive polymer micelles consisting of poly(styrene-co-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate)-block-poly(polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether acrylate) (P(St-co-DMAEA)-b-PPEGA) for zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) delivery. In this study, poly(butyl-co-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl acrylates)-block-poly(polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether acrylate) (P(BA-co-DMAEA)-b-PPEGA) was synthesized via reversible addition and fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to explore the role of neutral hydrophobic units in photosensitizer delivery. The composition of DMAEA units in P(BA-co-DMAEA) was adjusted to 0.46, which is comparable to that of P(St-co-DMAEA)-b-PPEGA. The size distribution of the P(BA-co-DMAEA)-b-PPEGA micelles changed when the pH decreased from 7.4 to 5.0, indicating their pH-responsive ability. The photosensitizers, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)chlorin (TFPC), 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (TFPP), protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), and ZnPc were examined as payloads for the P(BA-co-DMAEA)-b-PPEGA micelles. The encapsulation efficiency depended on the nature of the photosensitizer. TFPC-loaded P(BA-co-DMAEA)-b-PPEGA micelles exhibited higher photocytotoxicity than free TFPC in the MNNG-induced mutant of the rat murine RGM-1 gastric epithelial cell line (RGK-1), indicating their superiority for photosensitizer delivery. ZnPc-loaded P(BA-co-DMAEA)-b-PPEGA micelles also exhibited superior photocytotoxicity compared to free ZnPc. However, their photocytotoxicity was lower than that of P(St-co-DMAEA)-b-PPEGA. Therefore, neutral hydrophobic units, as well as pH-responsive units, must be designed for the encapsulation of photosensitizers.",

The EA-POSS with 0.25, 0.5 or 1 mol % of A-POSS exhibited significantly higher dynamic viscosity (ca. +104%), Mw (+61%) and polydispersity (+109%; measured using gel permeation chromatography) as well as lower Tg value (−16 °C) in relation to the A-POSS-free copolymer (EA-0). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (one glass transition process) confirmed statistic chain structure of the EA-POSS materials. Replacement of EA-0 by the EA-POSS copolymers in a SATs recipe caused simultaneous improvement of their self-adhesive features, i.e., adhesion (+70%), tack (+21%) and cohesion (+1590%). Moreover, the POSS-based copolymers improved the shear strength of thermally cured Al/SAT/Al overlap joints; the best mechanical resistance (before and after accelerated ageing tests) was observed for the sample containing 0.5 mol % of A-POSS (an increment range of 50–294% in relation to the A-POSS-free joints).

However, certain limitations such as lower impact strength and poor elongation at break restrict its use in demanding applications. To overcome these issues, chain extenders (CEs) are employed to enhance PLA's properties by chemically linking polymer chains together, thereby increasing the molecular weight and improving performance. This study investigates the synthesis and application of epoxy-functionalized styrene-butyl acrylate copolymers (P(ES-co-BA)) as chain extenders for PLA. Using free radical polymerization, copolymers with various compositions were developed and blended with PLA through melt reactive extrusion. Characterization of the resulting materials revealed significant enhancements compared to neat PLA, particularly in terms of molecular weight (75.8 %), impact properties (30.6 %), and thermal stability, with properties like or better than those of PLA with a commercial chain extender. This work demonstrates that the use of small amounts of P(ES-co-BA) offers a solution for overcoming critical limitations associated with PLA, effectively strengthening its ability for industrial use and broadening its potential applications.",

    "abstract": "Acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are used as fixatives between layers of a display. PSAs’ function is an important factor that determines the performance of the display. Of the various display types available, the touch screen panel (TSP) of smart devices is firmly related to the relative permittivity of the elementals. Therefore, adjusting the relative permittivity of the PSA is indispensable for driving the TSP. Accordingly, selected acrylic pre-polymers were polymerized and the pre-polymer was blended and cross-linked with monomers with different chemical structure to adjust the relative permittivity. The monomers were hexametyldisiloxane (HMDS), N-vinylcaprolactam (NVC), tert-butyl acrylate (TBA), and isooctadecyl acrylate (ISTA). The gel fraction and transmittance as a function of the monomers show a similar result to the pure acrylic PSA. However, the gel fraction value decreased to about 90% and the transmittance decreased to about 85%, due to the immiscibility between nonpolar HMDS and acrylic PSA. On the other hand, the adhesion properties were improved when NVC was added because of the polarity of the nitrogen group. In addition, the relative permittivity of the PSA decreased regardless of the monomer chosen. There was, however, a difference in the optimal content of each monomer, and NVC decreased from 4 phr content to about 3.4 in reducing relative permittivity. Through the above results, it was confirmed that NVC having a nitrogen group is most advantageous in lowering adhesion properties and relative permittivity, and necessitates further research based on the findings.",

The main hypothesis, based on the concept that the emulsion polymerization reaction occurs very quickly, is that emulsifier placed in the polymerization system is immediately wrapped on the surface of the latex particles. It is proposed that if the latex particle surface area growth (ΔS) and the latex particle surface area which is stabilized by added emulsifier () satisfy the relationship of , the polymerization system will be a relatively stable system where N is the number of seed latex particles and (/N)0.3 and (/N)0.7 signify the surface area of each stable latex particle when the coverage rate of emulsifier is 30% and 70%, respectively. Based on this hypothesis, the influences of emulsifier amount, diameter of the seeded latexes and distribution of the emulsifier in initial emulsion and the emulsifier added dropwise during the polymerization on the emulsion polymerization stability is simulated and calculated to realize the minimum aggregation during polymerization. According to the simulation results, two optimized polymerization process parameters were determined and verified through experiments based on the emulsion copolymerization of vinyl acetate, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid.",

Different terpolymerizations at low and medium‐high conversions are performed at optimized feed compositions. Estimations are made using the error‐in‐variables model (EVM) framework, applying the recast form of the Alfrey–Goldfinger (AG) model and a direct numerical integration (DNI) approach to the collected data. Estimations from individual low and medium‐high conversion data are compared to those found with the combined data (full conversion range data). The highest certainty in point estimates are obtained with analysis of the full conversion range data. Furthermore, the reactivity ratios determined from the combined data fall between those found with analysis of individual low and medium‐high conversion data, another corroboration of reliable data collection. Reactivity ratios determined from analysis of the combined data (rSiA/MMA = 0.4185, rMMA/SiA = 1.3754, rSiA/BA = 0.8739, rBA/SiA = 0.5736, rBA/MMA = 0.3692, rMMA/BA = 1.7919) are used in the recast AG model to predict cumulative terpolymer composition as a function of conversion.

    "abstract": "In this work, a novel total non-ionic polystyrene-polyurethane (PS-PU) composite latex was synthesized with polymerizable polyethylene glycol ether. Contrary to traditional styrene-butyl acrylate latex (St-BA), PS-PU has a smaller size and superior dispersion stability, and it is stable in saturated Ca(OH)2 even after 72 h. In fresh-mixed mortars, PS-PU showed a little adverse effect on workability and insignificant air entrainment, with little defoamer consumption. The retardation effect of PS-PU is also much milder than traditional St-BA. As for strength, PS-PU showed a less adverse effect on early and late age compressive strength, but its effect on flexural strength is not as pronounced as St-BA at high dosages (4% and 6%). The different behavior in cementitious materials between PS-PU and St-BA can be reasoned from their different adsorption behavior and surface charge properties, as the results from characterizations suggest. The non-ionic nature of PS-PU made it less prone to destabilization and adsorption, which turned out as the aforementioned behavior in cementitious systems. The difference can further be ascribed to the difference in their polymeric structure and properties.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the influence of an amino silane (3-(2-aminoethylamino)-propyldimethoxymethylsilane, AEAPS) on the interfacial structure and adhesion of butyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate copolymers (BAMMAs) to silica was investigated by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG). Small amounts of methacrylic acid, MAA, were included in the BAMMA polymerizations to assess the impact of carboxylic acid functionality on the glass interface. SFG was used to probe the O-H and C═O groups of incorporated MAA, ester C═O groups of BAMMA, and CH groups from all species at the silica interfaces. The addition of AEAPS resulted in a significant change in the molecular structure of the polymer at the buried interface with silica due to specific interactions between the BAMMA polymers and silane. SFG results were consistent with the formation of ionic bonds between the primary and secondary amines of the AEAPS tail group and the MAA component of the polymer, as evidenced by the loss of the MAA O-H and C═O signals at the interface. It is extensively reported in the literature that methoxy head groups of an amino silane chemically bind to the silanols of glass, leaving the amine groups available to react with various chemical functionalities. Our results are consistent with this scenario and support an adhesion promotion mechanism of amino silane with various aspects: (1) the ionic bond formation between the tail amine group and acid functionality on BAMMA, (2) the chemical coupling between the silane head group and glass, (3) migration of more ester C═O groups to the interface with order, and (4) disordering or reduced levels of CH groups at the interface.

In this study, a copolymer-templated nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (CTNC) has been prepared via a simple carbonization procedure of well-defined polyacrylonitrile-block-poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PAN-b-PBA) block copolymer precursors. The structure and morphology were characterized by transmission electron microsphere (TEM), adsorption-desorption isotherms, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Owing to its high specific area, hierarchical open-porous structure, and the introduction of nitrogen atoms in graphitic sp2 network, the adsorbent CTNC exhibited high removal efficiency toward bilirubin and bile acid from human plasma. The removal rate of bilirubin was more than 50.7% with a minimal loss of albumin. Meanwhile, exceeding 95% of bile acid was eliminated. The effect of albumin on the adsorption kinetic of bilirubin was identified. The result indicated that the adsorption rate of BSA-bonded bilirubin experienced a decline than that of free bilirubin, but the adsorption capacity was still up to 39.8 mg/g within 2 h. Moreover, the effect of porosity and nitrogen contents on bilirubin adsorption ability and blood compatibility were systematically investigated.

The PP/propylene-based-elastomer (PP/PBE) blend films were prepared as test samples. Then the samples were soaked in liquid chemicals of the four main crosslinking byproducts of 1,4-bis (tert-butyl peroxy isopropyl) benzene (BIPB) separately, which has been widely used as the crosslinking agent for EBA. The structure changes of the samples were evaluated by the Fourier transform infrared spectrum. The carrier trap, DC conductivity, space charge accumulation, and DC breakdown strength of the samples were measured. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to assist in the analysis of the diffusion of byproducts. The results indicated that the byproducts resulted in the generation of numerous shallow traps, leading to an enhancement in conductivity, substantial space charge accumulation, and reduction of DC breakdown strength of the insulation materials. Furthermore, the byproducts contributed to higher electric field distortion and a faster decay rate of charge. It was observed that small molecules appeared to have higher diffusion rates in PP/PBE blends. It is suggested that diffusion is a critical factor leading to the various impacts of the byproducts on the insulation properties of the blends.",

The introduction of such polar and functional reactants affects the radical copolymerization kinetics and introduces solvent dependencies. A series of BMA/HEA experiments are performed to determine the influence of these changing kinetic parameters under starved‐feed semibatch operating conditions. A comparison with BMA/BA copolymerizations shows that the influence of hydrogen bonding is small, with the semibatch system well controlled to HEA contents of up to 50 wt%. Thus, the experiments are well represented by a comprehensive generalized copolymerization model that considers relevant methacrylate and acrylate side‐reactions and uses the chain growth parameters measured in previous kinetic investigations.",

Selected commercial adhesion promoters were tested as additives in the formulation of adhesive compositions, i.e., (i) an organic copolymer with polar groups (carboxyl and hydroxyl); (ii) a hydroxymetal-organic compound; and (iii) a quaternary ammonium salt and (iv) a chlorinated polyolefin. No fillers, crosslinking agents, or photoinitiators were used in the adhesive compositions. NMR techniques confirmed the incorporation of silicon atoms into the polyacrylate structure. The influence of adhesion promoters on the kinetics of the UV-crosslinking process of Si-PSAs was investigated by a photo-DSC technique. The obtained Si-PSAs were characterized by adhesion (to steel, glass, PMMA, and PE), tack, and cohesion at 20 °C. Finally, the wetting angle of Si-PSAs with water was checked and their thermal stability was proved (TGA). Unexpectedly, the quaternary ammonium salt had the most favorable effect on improving the thermal stability of Si-PSAs (302 °C) and adhesion to glass and PMMA.

We used the so called UV210 polymer for shaping the core waveguide. The UV210 polymer made up of poly (p-hydroxystyrene) and poly (t-butyl acrylate) is a chemically amplified resin; a photo-acid generator is added to the matrix of the copolymer in order to increase the sensitivity of the resin and create a chain reaction during developments so as to develop sub-wavelength patterns. Several families of multilayers structures have been produced by specific sub-wavelength lithography plus PECVD, and then properly characterized by including stoichiometry analyses plus imaging by Raman. The advantage of achieving Si/SiO2/UV210/Si/SiO2 symmetry relates first of all to the equations of electromagnetism and guidance which no longer impose a cut-off thickness (or frequency) during extreme miniaturization, but also for an adequate protection of the components by an upper layer of silicon covering the surface of the chip for sensor applications and specific detection of aggressive substances / agents. All structures, including the addition of silicon directly onto the organic, exhibit excellent mechanical strength and optical stability; the last silicon/silica bilayer also acts as a thin protective shell. Various families of resonant photonic structures could be cleanly characterized on platform. Furthermore, by statistical measurements of resonance parameters, we conclude that the processes and properties of the materials obtained have good reproducibility.

    "abstract": "The direct copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers to produce functional polyolefins continues to be highly appealing due to its simple operation process and controllable product microstructure. Low-cost nickel catalysts have been extensively utilized in academia for the synthesis of polar polyethylenes. However, the development of high-temperature copolymerization catalysts suitable for industrial production conditions remains a significant challenge. Classified by the resultant copolymers, this review provides a comprehensive summary of the research progress in nickel complex catalyzed ethylene-polar monomer copolymerization at elevated temperatures in the past five years. The polymerization results of ethylene–methyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene-tert–butyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene–other fundamental polar monomer copolymers, and ethylene–special polar monomer copolymers are thoroughly summarized. The involved nickel catalysts include the phosphine-phenolate type, bisphosphine-monoxide type, phosphine-carbonyl type, phosphine-benzenamine type, and the phosphine-enolate type. The effective modulation of catalytic activity, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, melting point, and polar monomer incorporation ratio by these catalysts is concluded and discussed. It reveals that the optimization of the catalyst system is mainly achieved through the methods of catalyst structure rational design, extra additive introduction, and single-site catalyst heterogenization. As a result, some outstanding catalysts are capable of producing polar polyethylenes that closely resemble commercial products. To achieve industrialization, it is essential to further emphasize the fundamental science of high-temperature copolymerization systems and the application performance of resultant polar polyethylenes.",

In accordance with the “grafting from” strategy, a naturally-occurring star-like polymer with a polar 3,3',4',5,6-pentahydroxyflavone core and hydrophobic poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) side arms was synthesized via a simplified electrochemically mediated ATRP (seATRP), utilizing only 78 ppm by weight (wt) of a catalytic CuII complex. To demonstrate the possibility of temporal control, seATRP was carried out utilizing a multiple-step potential electrolysis. The rate of the polymerizations was well-controlled by applying optimal potential values during preparative electrolysis to prevent the possibility of intermolecular coupling of the growing polymer arms. This appears to be the first report using on-demand seATRP for the synthesis of QC-(PtBA-Br)5 pseudo-star polymers. The naturally-derived macromolecules showed narrow MWDs (Đ = 1.08–1.11). 1H NMR spectral results confirm the formation of quercetin-based polymers.

    "abstract": "Separating water‐in‐heavy oil (W/HO) emulsions at low (room) temperature is challenging when exploiting heavy oil. We propose an adaptable strategy for constructing Si/O‐doped demulsifiers. A nonionic demulsifier (APBMP) has been synthesized based on polysiloxane modified by allyl polyether and butyl acrylate. APBMP achieves 95.97% dehydration within 5 min for W/HO emulsions at 288.15 K and complete dehydration in 15 min at 323.15 K. Mechanistic studies found that doping Si/O into the demulsifier molecules increases the number of hydrogen bond sites, which enables the demulsifiers to quickly disperse natural stabilizers (e.g., asphaltenes) and replace them at the oil–water interfacial film. The demulsifiers prefer to occupy the interfacial sites rather than dissolve into the bulk oil or water phases. Driven by hydrogen‐bond‐dominated noncovalent interactions, the oil–water interfacial film is softened, reconstructed, and broken. These findings provide insights into developing novel materials for oil–water separations in a low‐carbon way.",

However, there has been a wide concern about using Gemini surfactants to prepare cationic polymer latex to improve its properties. The purpose of this paper was to focus on the synthesis of novel self-crosslinked cationic fluorinated acrylic latex (SCFAL), during which the copolymerised monomers were initiated with a water soluble azo initiator and emulsified with mixed surfactants of Gemini emulsifier and alkyl polyglycoside (APG).\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe novel SCFAL was prepared successfully by the semi-continuous seeded emulsion polymerisation of butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, hexafluorobutyl methacrylate (HFMA) and hydroxy propyl methacrylate (HPMA) in aqueous medium.\n\n\nFindings\nThe conversion is the maximum and the coagulation percentage the minimum when the amounts of emulsifier and initiator are 8 and 0.6 per cent, respectively. The average particle size of the latex is significantly reduced with the increase of the amount of emulsifiers used. However, the average particle size of the latex is increased with the increase of the amount of HPMA. The particle size of the latex is of a unimodal distribution, which means that the particle size was reasonably uniform. Contact angle is increased with the increase of the amount of the HFMA.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe novel SCFAL can be widely used as significant components in the field of coatings, leather, textile, paper, adhesives and so on.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nSCFAL, which was emulsified with novel mixed surfactants of Gemini surfactant and APG, has been prepared successfully.

When styrene was added as a reactive diluent, the biocomposites had a more homogeneous structure, and their thermal resistance was higher than those with acrylate monomers.

The present research work deals with the synthesis of a poly(methyl methacrylate-n-butyl acrylate-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (poly[MMA-BA-NVP]) tercopolymer through free radical polymerization for surface coating thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) based voice prostheses. The NVP content in the tercopolymer was varied from 20% to 50% to optimise iodine loading and subsequent release. Base TPU coated with the tercopolymer was treated with 4% aqueous iodine solution at room temperature (28 ± 3 °C) for two hours.

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Sequence control has attracted increasing attention for its ability of regulating polymer property and performance. Herein, the sequence-controlled polymer containing acrylonitrile (AN) is achieved by using 2,5-dimethylfuran/acrylonitrile adduct as a latent monomer. The temperature-dependent retro Diels-Alder reaction is engaged in controlling the release of AN during RAFT polymerization, that is, regulating the instant AN concentration via a non-invasive and in situ manner. Such control over the instant AN concentration and particularly the molar ratio of comonomer pair leads to the simultaneous change of monomer units in \"living\" polymeric chain, thus resulting in the sequence-controlled polymeric structures. By delicately manipulating the polymerization temperature, diverse sequence-on-demand structures of AN-containing copolymers, such as poly(AN/methyl methacrylate), poly(AN/styrene), poly(AN/butyl acrylate), poly(AN/N,N-dimethylacrylamide), and poly(AN/N-isopropylacrylamide) are created. Meanwhile, this study presents an initial attempt in tuning the thermal responsivity of poly(AN/N-isopropylacrylamide), which is closely correlated to the sequence of polymer structure. More importantly, the polymer with averagely distributed AN units results in the higher thermal sensitivity. Therefore, the synthetic strategy proposed in this work offers a promising platform for accessing the sequence-controlled copolymers containing AN structures, thus expanding the investigation on the relationship between the polymer structures and correlated properties.",

Modification of bitumen with a copolymer of ethylene with butyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate leads to an improvement in the properties of road bitumen: the softening point, hardness, deformability at low temperatures, elasticity, and adhesion to metal and mineral filler increase. It was shown that ethylene with butyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate chemically interacts with the functional groups of bitumen asphaltenes through the epoxy group of glycidyl methacrylate. Analysis of the spectra and group composition indicates an increased content of high molecular weight asphaltenes in the modified bitumen with a slight increase in structuring resins. It has been established that bitumen modified with rubber crumbs of 0.6–1.0 mm in size has high elasticity. The most effective composition of a bitumen-regenerated composite material based on tire reclaim has been determined. In terms of the totality of physicochemical and operational characteristics and comparative cost, the most acceptable is the bitumen-regenerated composition (with a regenerate content of 20%) and is superior in the complex of properties to bitumen modified with an optimal content of ethylene with butyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate (1.6%). The technology for modifying bitumen with tire reclaim is less time-consuming, more economically profitable, and environmentally effective, since it utilizes large-tonnage waste of worn-out tires.

New nitrogen containing heterocyclic azo compounds have been synthesized by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a catalyst having a particle size of 15 nm.

These synthesized nitrogen‐containing heterocyclic pigments were characterized by melting points, UV–vis, FT‐IR, and 1H NMR spectroscopy for their characteristics and structural features. After analysis, these pigments at lower concentrations were blended with the n‐butyl acrylate–co‐methyl methacrylate (n‐BA‐co‐MMA) polymer. These blended pigments were coated on a simple silica glass surface by following the simple deep and dry method.

    "abstract": "The revolutionary self-healing function for long-term and safe service processes has inspired researchers to implement them in various fields, including in the application of antimicrobial protective coatings. Despite the great advances that have been made in the field of fabricating self-healing and antimicrobial polymers, their poor transparency and the trade-off between the mechanical and self-healing properties limit the utility of the materials as transparent antimicrobial protective coatings for wearable optical and display devices. Considering the compatibility in the blending process, our group proposed a self-healing, self-cross-linkable poly{(n-butyl acrylate)-co-[N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide]} copolymer (AP)-based protective coating combined with two types of commercial cationic antimicrobial agents (i.e., dimethyl octadecyl (3-trimethoxysilylpropyl) ammonium chloride (DTSACL) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)), leading to the fabrication of a multifunctional modified compound film of (AP/b%CHG)-grafted-a%DTSACL. The first highlight of this research is that the reactivity of the hydroxyl group in the N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide of the copolymer side chains under thermal conditions facilitates the “grafting to” process with the trimethoxysilane groups of DTSACL to form AP-grafted-DTSACL, yielding favorable thermal stability, improvement in hydrophobicity, and enhancement of mechanical strength. Second, we highlight that the addition of CHG can generate covalent and noncovalent interactions in a complex manner between the two biguanide groups of CHG with the AP and DTSACL via a thermal-triggered cross-linking reaction. The noncovalent interactions synergistically serve as diverse dynamic hydrogen bonds, leading to complete healing upon scratches and even showing over 80% self-healing efficiency on full-cut, while covalent bonding can effectively improve elasticity and mechanical strength. The soft nature of CHG also takes part in improving the self-healing of the copolymer. Moreover, it was discovered that the addition of CHG can enhance antimicrobial effectiveness, as demonstrated by the long-term superior antibacterial activity (100%) against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria and the antifouling function on a glass substrate and/or a silica wafer coated by the modified polymer.",

ESSENCE—IJERC | Jaspal et al. (2018) | IX (1): 46—54 47 Introduction The process of emulsion polymerization consists of dispersing a uniform emulsion in an aqueous phase with the aid of surfactants. Emulsion polymerization can also be defined as an addition polymerization process which proceeds by micellar mechanism. The polymer formed is stabilized within the emulsion by absorption onto surfactants as the polymerization proceeds. This gives polymers with high molecular weight, greater flexibility, good reproducibility, rapid reactions, high monomer conversion and low cost relative to other polymerization techniques. Compared to other heterogeneous polymerization, like suspension or precipitation, it is likely the most complicated system; all this factor make modeling of this system very difficult (Aggarwal et. al., 2007; Alexander and Napper, 1971). Acrylate emulsions manufactured by this technique are widely used in preparing emulsion paints. Acrylate emulsions are widely used owing to their good water resistance, weather resistance, ageing resistance and flexibility at low temperature (Antonietti and Landfester, 2002). They have excellent durability, which makes them suitable for indoor and outdoor decorative paints, and can be formulated into highresistance coatings for industrial uses. Selfcrosslinked acrylate emulsions can be prepared via molecular design when some functional groups are introduced into the molecular chain of a polymer (Aslamazova, 1995; Asua, 2002; Barrett, 1975). Many studies have been carried out to analyze the effect of the nature and type of the emulsifier in emulsion polymerization. Emelie et al (Bockhorn, 1992) studied the batch emulsion copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate using anionic (Sodium lauryl sulfate) and nonionic (polyethylene oxide ether) surfactants and other studied the stabilization (Candau, 1992) effect of mixed surfactant effect system in the batch polymerization of styrene, work was later continued by Chu and coworkers using methyl methacrylate and bytyl acrylate. Gan et al., (1993) and Candau, (1999) have carried out extensive work on micro emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate and other acrylate monomers, using various types of surfactant. Representative review or journal articles concerning emulsion polymerization can be found in references (Capek, 1999; Capek, 1999a; Capek, 1999b; Capek, 2001; Capek, 2002; Capek and Chern, 2001; Chern, 2002; Chern, 2003; Chu and Lin, 1992; Cunningham, 2002; El-Aasser and Miller, 1997; Emelie et. al., 1985; Gan et. al., 1993; Gao and Penlidis, 2002; Guyot, 1999; Kawaguchi, 2000; Leonardi et. al., 2005; Li and Brooks, 1992; Li-jun et. al., 2008; Moriguchi et al., 1999; Nagai, 1996; Nomura and Tobita, 2005; Poehlein and Dougherty, 1977; Snuparek, 1996; Sudol and El-Aasser, 1997; Tian-ying et. al., 2005; Tianying et. al., 2006; Ugelstad and Hansen, 1976). In this work, self-crosslinked acrylate emulsion with high elasticity was prepared via pre-emulsified and semi-continuous seeded emulsion polymerization technology by using N hydroxyl methyl acrylamide as self-crosslinked monomer and poly solidum maleate as protective colloid. Possible cross-linked mechanism of self-crosslinked monomer was put forward. In addition, the rheological properties of the prepared acrylate emulsion were analyzed (Vanderhoff, 1985; Wang et. al., 1994; Yan-jun et. al., 2003). Experimental Raw materials Butyl acrylate (BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) were distilled under reduced pressure to remove the polymerization inhibitor before use. Potassium persulfate (KPS, Sigma-Aldrich) was recrystallized from water. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Fisher), Nmethylol acrylamide (NMA, Sigma-Aldrich), hexadecane (HD, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and NaHCO3 (E.Merk), ammonia water (E.Merk), methacrylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), Nhydroxymethyl acrylamide (Sigma-Aldrich), poly sodium maleate were used. All the chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade. Deionized water was used for preparation of the solutions. grade. Deionized water was used for preparation of the solutions. ESSENCE—IJERC | Jaspal et al. (2018) | IX (1): 46—54 48 Method Pre-Emulsification: The pre-emulsification having two components, one was a solution of the surfactant system in water and the second was a mixture of monomers in the required ratio (like 45:55:: 50:50:: 55:45:: 60:40 of MMA & BA respectively for 50±1 solid content) and special monomer (like AA, NMA, GMA). The solution of the surfactant system contains anionic and non-ionic surfactant. The mixture of monomers was dispersed into the solution of surfactant with high speed stirring. Semi Continuous Emulsion Polymerization: The semi continuous emulsion polymerization was carried out in a glass reactor. The surfactant solution containing ~33% anionic surfactant, buffer and other additives as required was charged into the reactor, the whole system was set up and heated to 80-85oC. The initiator dissolved in a desired quantity of de-ionized water was added just before the seed; then 40g of pre-emulsion was added in reactor as a seed. After 15 min of seeding, the feed flow was started. The feed containing preemulsion was added over 150 min at 80 ± 2°C temperature. The polymerization was continued thereafter in batch for about 1 hour, to kill unreacted monomer. After 1 hr. the reactor cooled down to 35 °C and ammonia was added drop wise for adjustment to pH (8-9). The emulsion was discharged from glass reactor and filtered through 200 mesh. Characterization The emulsion prepared was characterized for their ability to perform as a binder in paints. 1. Solid Content (% NVM): This method is used to determine the percentage of non-voaltile material. The weighed quantity of sample was wrapped in aluminium foil and then kept in oven at 105 °C for 3 hours. The amount of solid content was determined by using following formula: %NVM = (W3 – W1)/ (W2 – W1) X 100 Where, W1 = Weight of empty aluminium foil W2 = Weight of aluminium foil with sample W3 = Weight after drying sample 2. pH at 300 °C: A digital pH meter standardized against buffer solution was employed. 3. Viscosity (poise): The viscosity of the emulsion was tested by Brookfield viscometer at 300 °C. Then calculated by given formula: Viscosity = (Recorded X Tablulated ) ÷ 100 4. Particle size (nm): The droplet sizes of unpolymerized microemulsions and the particle sizes of polymerized latexes were determined with a transmission electron microscope. 5. Freeze-thaw stability (cycle): The exact test condition may be varied to suit the condition expected to be encounted in actual use. A typical cycle involves freezing at -15 °C for 16 hours, followed by thawing at ambient temperature. This cycle was repeated as often as required. 6. Electrolytic stability: The electrolytic stability was tested by using 10% solution of CaCl2. The equal volume of the emulsion and solution of CaCl2 was kept at room temperature for 72 hours. 7. Minimum film forming temperature: Minimum Film Forming Temperature (MFFT) is the lowest temperature at which an emulsion will uniformly coalesce when laid on a substrate as a thin film. Continuous films are obtained at a temperature near the glass transition temperature of the polymer or more precisely, above the MFFT. 8. Hardness: Hardness is defined as a resistance of a material to deformation, indentation or scratching. The test was performed using Rock well hardness. A specimen was kept on a hard, flat surface and an average of ",

First, a series of free radical bulk copolymerizations of CLA/styrene (Sty) and CLA/butyl acrylate (BA) were run for reactivity ratio estimation. This was followed by CLA/Sty/BA bulk terpolymerizations. Pseudo‐kinetic models were developed and validated with the copolymerization data and extended and validated for the CLA/Sty/BA terpolymerization case. The pseudo‐kinetic models incorporated the electron trapping effect of oleic acid, a common impurity found in CLA. A series of emulsion terpolymerizations of CLA/Sty/BA were then designed to investigate the influence of terpolymer composition, molecular weight, chain transfer agent concentration, cross‐linker concentration, latex viscosity and particle size on PSA performance (tack, peel strength and shear strength). Empirical PSA performance models were developed and expressed as 3D response surfaces for optimization of the PSA formulation. All experiments were performed at 80°C and monitored with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR‐FTIR) spectroscopy both off‐line (bulk experiments) and in‐line (emulsion experiments). Ultimately, the incorporation of 30 wt.% CLA into a practical PSA application suitable for removable adhesives was achieved.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computation possesses the advantages of self‐learning, highly parallel computation, and low energy consumption, and is of great promise to overcome the bottleneck of von Neumann computation. In this work, a series of poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT)‐based block copolymers (BCPs) with different coil segments, including polystyrene, poly(2‐vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(2‐vinylnaphthalene), and poly(butyl acrylate), are utilized in photosynaptic transistor to emulate paired‐pulse facilitation, spike time/rate‐dependent plasticity, short/long‐term neuroplasticity, and learning−forgetting−relearning processes. P3HT serves as a carrier transport channel and a photogate, while the insulating coils with electrophilic groups are for charge trapping and preservation. Three main factors are unveiled to govern the properties of these P3HT‐based BCPs: i) rigidity of the insulating coil, ii) energy levels between the constituent polymers, and iii) electrophilicity of the insulating coil. Accordingly, P3HT‐b‐P2VP‐based photosynaptic transistor with a sought‐after BCP combination demonstrates long‐term memory behavior with current contrast up to 105, short‐term memory behavior with high paired‐pulse facilitation ratio of 1.38, and an ultralow energy consumption of 0.56 fJ at an operating voltage of −0.0003 V.

HMAs were prepared with mixtures of EVA copolymers with 18 (EVA18) and 27 (EVA27) wt% vinyl acetate contents and EBA copolymer with 27 wt% n-butyl acrylate, polyterpene resin and mixture of microcrystalline and Fischer-Tropsch waxes. HMAs made with EBA/EVA blends showed lower viscosities and reduced shear thinning than the ones made with EBA or EVA due to differences in compatibility, but both the set time and the open time were not affected as they depended mainly on the wax nature and amount. The increase of the vinyl acetate (VA) content in EVA copolymer reduced the crystallinity of the EBA/EVA blends.

The addition of polyterpene resin and the mixture of waxes decreased the compatibility of the EBA/EVA blends, the higher compatibility was observed for the HMAs made with only one copolymer. The tack of the HMAs depended on their EBA/EVA contents, EBA/EVA27 HMAs showed broader temperature interval with higher tack, while the tack of EBA/EVA18 HMAs blend decreased and the temperature interval with tack was shortened and shifted to lower temperatures. Adhesion to polypropylene film was improved in HMAs made with 75 wt% EBA/25 wt% EVA18 and 50–75 wt% EBA/50-25 wt% EVA27.

However, it is still a challenge to design the highly desired smart electronic devices with triple and multishape memory performances through a facile method. Here, a novel dual-cross-linked poly(acrylonitrile-co-butyl acrylate-co-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-zinc methacrylate) (Zn-PABHM) copolymer was developed via a facile and one-pot free radical polymerization strategy. Ionic cross-linking, the transcarbamoylation reaction, and glass transition were used to fix the permanent shape and two temporary shapes of the obtained ionomer vitrimer, respectively. The thermomechanical and stress relaxation performances of Zn-PABHM vitrimer can be customized by tuning the proportion of the chemical cross-linking and physical cross-linking knots. Furthermore, the Zn-PABHM was employed to construct a shape memory triboelectric nanogenerator, which demonstrates distinctive performance and tunable electrical outputs (37.4-96.0 V) due to variable contact areas enabled by triple shape memory effects. Consequently, the triple-shape memory ionomer vitrimer obtained via a facile and one-pot synthetic strategy has great potential in smart multifunctional electronic devices.",

Acridine/LA complexes exhibit tunable excited state reduction potentials ranging from +2.07 to 2.38 V vs. SCE. The ytterbium triflate complex of 3,6-di-t-butyl-9-mesitylacridine catalyzes a photochemical Giese-type reaction of Boc-protected secondary amines with challenging conjugate acceptors such as acrylates, that are inaccessible to the analogous acridinium (t-Bu-Mes-Acr⊕) catalyzed reaction. The mechanism of this reaction was investigated using a suite of physical organic probes including intramolecular 13C kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), variable time normalization analysis (VTNA) kinetics, determination of redox potentials, and computational studies. In the reaction catalyzed by t-Bu-Mes-Acr⊕, mechanistic studies are consistent with single-electron transfer (SET) from the ground-state reduced t-Bu-Mes-Acr• to the α-keto radical intermediate as the first irreversible step in the catalytic cycle. Intriguingly, we find that the reduced acridine/LA complexes are better ground state reductants (-0.72 to -0.74 V vs SCE) relative to t-Bu-Mes-Acr• (-0.59 V vs SCE) and predict that the increased substrate reactivity stems from a lower energy barrier for this key SET event.",

    "abstract": "One-step photopolymerization and photochromism of clusteroluminescence (CL) polymers mean that the polymer materials can be prepared on a large scale and applied widely. Herein, we reported unique photochromic CL polymers prepared by one-step radical photopolymerization. Seven copolymerized films (PMAxBA) with methyl acrylate and butyl acrylate as monomers, a cross-linked PMA (PMA-CL) film, a double-network PMAPBA film based on the first network PMA-CL, and four PMA films with increasing content of photoinitiator ethoxy benzoin (BEE) were prepared to study CL formation and transition. Experimental results prove that increasing the ratio of the PMA chains in PMAxBA enhances the photochromic effect, which verifies the main role of PMA chains with the shorter branched alkanes. Surprisingly, cross-linking in PMA-CL strengthens interchain packing and interchain through-space interactions (TSIs), leading to the formation of larger clusters and further CL redshift from 410 to 491 nm, whereas the PBA chains filled in the cross-linked network weakens interchain TSIs among PMA chains and makes CL red shift from 410 to 472 nm. In addition, as the BEE content increases in the PMA films, a higher radical concentration also promotes the formation of TSIs and clusters, which benefits the photochromism. For applications, colorless, dissolvable, and thermoplastic PMA featuring photochromism in this case can be widely used in information loading, rewriting, and multifunctional coating.

A series of viscosity-reducing agents were developed by incorporating varying amounts of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) monomers. The reaction mechanism of epoxy acrylate viscosity reducer was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Additionally, the particle size and Zeta potential were used to analyze the stability of the polymer and the difference in the polymer after adding GMA monomer. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis indicated a significant improvement in the thermal stability of the resin due to GMA modification. The viscosity reduction test results demonstrated a substantial decrease in the viscosity of heavy oil, along with a notable increase in the viscosity reduction rate. The FTIR analysis results confirmed that GMA successfully introduced polyacrylate molecular chains. Furthermore, particle size and Zeta potential measurements showed that the average particle size of the emulsion increased from 132 nm to 187 nm, while the Zeta potential changed from −43 mV to −40 mV with the addition of 15% GMA. Compared with W0, the final thermal degradation temperature of W15 increased from 450 °C to 517 °C. When the GMA content reached 15 wt%, the maximum weight loss temperature increased by approximately 12 °C compared to the sample without GMA. Specifically, adding 8% W15 epoxy acrylate resulted in an 89% viscosity reduction rate for heavy oil, demonstrating an excellent viscosity reduction effect.

Diversified properties of acrylic resins have been utilised for the development of acrylic cationic electrodeposition multicolour mono-coat corrosion protective coatings by acrylic graft polymer of methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, styrene, and methyl methacrylate in the presence of hydroxy propyl acrylate at 113–117°C in the presence of AIBN (Azo-bis iso-butyronitrile) as the initiator. The concept was to develop acrylic graft polymer wherein chemical bonds are protected against UV radiation 400 h or 18-month outdoor exposure. Developed acrylic resin has special characteristic e.g. excellent metal protection against corrosion 500 h salt spray test as per ASTM B117, excellent durability, economical primer, and finish coat in single application and meeting the International and National legislation. Resulting polymers were characterised by using FTIR spectroscopy, particle size analyser and other Morden instrumental techniques. Thus the obtained polymers have high solid content (72 ± 1%) and can be used in electrodeposition emulsion paint as a binder. The coatings are mono-coat prepared and their anticorrosion behaviour is discussed in this paper. The experimental results depict that the resin thus synthesised has high anticorrosive property, UV light stability, and excellent weather resistance.",

    "abstract": "Flexible and accurate control of microswimmers is significant for lots of applications. Herein, we present a method for effective microswimmer manipulation in multiple microfluidic systems by thermal buoyancy-capillary convection. In the microdevice, four strips of microheaters arranged at the bottom of the microchannel are used to unevenly heat microfluids, and the convection flow forms under the influence of gravity and interfacial tension gradient. By adjusting the DC signals applied on these four heating elements, the intensity and direction of convection flow can be flexibly adjusted. Accordingly, granular samples dispersed in liquid buffer can be controllably driven to the target position by the Stokes drag. The swimming behavior of polystyrene (PS) microspheres at the solid-liquid interface of the device is first investigated. It shows that the PS microswimmers can migrate along various geometrical patterns by powering the microheaters with designed voltage combinations, and the migration velocity is positively affected by the increased voltage. Then, the butyl acrylate (BA) microswimmers are manipulated at the gas-liquid interface of the microchip. It turns out that the BA microswimmers migrate oppositely compared with PS swimmers under the same energization strategy. Additionally, the translation direction of BA swimmers can be changed over a 360° range by different voltage combinations. The multifunctionality of our approach is further demonstrated by conveniently driving the trimethylolpropane triacrylate microswimmers at the liquid-liquid interface of the microplatform along different directions and pathlines. Therefore, this technique can be promising for many cases needing granular sample control, such as cargo delivery and sensing.",

Brittle failure can often be avoided by incorporating a small fraction of filler particles. Core–shell composite particles composed of a rubbery core and a glassy shell have recently attracted interest as a toughening agent for brittle polymers. Here, core/shell organic–inorganic hybrid polymer nanoparticles (Si-ASA HPNs) with a silicone-modified butyl acrylate copolymer (PBA) core and a styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN) shell were used to toughen PMMA. Silicone plays dual roles as a compatibilizer and a chain extender, and it not only improves interfacial adhesion between the PBA particles and SAN copolymer, but it also increases chain entanglement of poly(acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate) (ASA). The mechanical properties of the PMMA/ASA alloys strongly depend on the Si content, and the impact strength and elongation at break greatly improve when silicone-modified ASA is added. However, this is accompanied by loss of rigidity. Specifically, the PMMA/ASA-2 composite exhibits a good balance between toughness and rigidity, indicating that ASA-2 with 5 wt% KH570 is the most suitable impact modifier. This research provides a facile and practical method to overcome the shortcomings of ASA and promote its application in a wider range of fields.",

Both the surfactants play different roles vital for proper emulsification and colloidal stability of the latex. Continuous emulsion polymerization process is employed to produce methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate copolymer latices by incorporation of ionic emulsifier (OPS-25) and non-ionic emulsifier (OP-25) in combination. Both the emulsifiers were experimented at various concentrations to observe their effect on different end-product properties, i.e., rheological, thermal and structural properties. To observe the effect of the emulsifiers on end properties, it was intended to produce a stable and durable commercial grade product and for this purpose, conventional water-borne emulsion polymerization technique was followed. In the product formulation, initially, the concentration of OP-25 is kept constant while the concentration of OPS-25 is varied, and then, the concentration of OP-25 is varied keeping the concentration of OPS-25 constant. Both the emulsifiers showed different effects on the final latex properties i.e. viscosity, abrasion scrub cycles, drying time and glass transition temperature. OPS-25 exhibited stronger effect in increasing the overall viscosity of the latex samples while OP-25 played a significant role in improving abrasion scrub cycles and drying time of the latex samples. OP-25 reinforced OPS-25 in maintaining glass transition temperature of the latex samples. On increasing the concentration of the emulsifiers beyond certain limits, they resulted in poor film properties of the latices. Both ionic and non-ionic emulsifiers strongly affected the end properties of the latices, however, the optimal properties were obtained when both the emulsifiers were employed within certain limits of their concentrations.",

As one effective measure of radioactive material purification, strippable coating, which effectively coats the pollutant, and settles them on the surface of objects. However, there are some shortcomings in terms of film formation and peelability, such as a brittle coating and poor peelability. Therefore, in order to meet the treatment methods for radioactive contaminants needs, the strippable coating must have excellent sealing, corrosion resistance, weather resistance, low environmental pollution, short film formation time, and good mechanical properties; in addition, the spraying process should be simple, with moderate adhesion, and it should be capable of being quickly and completely peeled off. In this paper, a ternary system was prepared by pre-emulsion polymerization with butyl-acrylate, methyl methacrylate, acrylic acid as the reactive monomer, sodium dodecyl sulfate as the active agent, potassium persulfate as the initiator, and water as the dispersion medium. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), ICP emission spectrometer, surface tension tester, and universal testing machine were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the composite materials. The results show that the decontaminant can quickly wet the powder particles and the surface pollutants. The sealing efficiency of Fe and Cu was over 90%. After the decontaminant was cured, it could be continuously formed on the surface of different substrates and be completely peeled off, as well as having excellent film formation and peelability.",

Itaconate ester monomer’s challenges incorporating in (meth)acrylic waterborne polymers are the low propagation rate, unfavorable reactivity ratios, and the depropagation process. To overcome these challenges, the seeded semibatch emulsion polymerization of 100% biobased dibutyl itaconate, methyl methacrylate, and butyl acrylate was investigated at different temperatures. Consequently, 30 wt % DBI was successfully incorporated within waterborne (meth)acrylates in short reaction times (4 h), obtaining high DBI incorporation (>90%). The results demonstrate that DBI incorporation influences the instantaneous monomer conversion, polymer’s microstructure, and mechanical properties. By incorporating a biobased itaconate cross-linker, kinetics and mechanical characteristics of the polymers were improved.

Currently, the application of various wastewater treatment processes for tert-butyl acrylate production wastewater is still restricted by energy-intensive factors. Aiming at addressing the trade-offs in water-energy nexus in purification of tert-butyl acrylate production wastewater, this study proposed a fluidized/fixed bed treatment system for catalytic oxidation purification of tert-butyl acrylate production wastewater. A high calorific value of rectification residue produced by the production of tert-butyl acrylate was introduced to simultaneously achieve low energy consumption and efficient purification of tert-butyl acrylate production wastewater and rectification residue. The effects of the operating conditions of fluidized and fixed beds and their coupling process on the purification effect of tert-butyl acrylate production wastewater were evaluated. Results showed that the efficiency of purifying tert-butyl acrylate production wastewater and rectification residue using the fluidized/fixed bed treatment system was considerable. The calculation results showed that the thermal balance of the system was enhanced due to the introduction of rectification residue, and the energy-saving rate reached 18%. Tert-butyl acrylate production wastewater was oxidized to small-molecule chemicals by proton transfer and demethylation during degradation process which was investigated by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Stability experiments indicated that the average removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand in fluidized/fixed bed treatment system was 97.0%–98.5% for 600 h of continuous operation. The Cu/Ce/Mn catalyst exhibited good stability. Therefore, fluidized/fixed bed treatment system can effectively purify high-concentration organic wastewater and is a promising technology.",

    "year": 2016,
    "abstract": "The development of new and more complex polymeric materials involves challenging problems to basic sciences. The relationship between structure and molecular dynamics assumes great importance for the future development of novel technologies based on such polymers. Thus, the understanding of how small changes in the chemical structure affect the properties of the material is essential to progress in the technological and scientific area. An in-depth analysis of the molecular mobility leads to establish the structure-properties relationships. On this basis, the main aim of the present work is to study the molecular mobility of two different families of polymeric materials. For this purpose, the experimental techniques mainly used were Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dielectric Relaxation Spectroscopy (DRS). The first family of polymers characterized was a series of chemically cross-linked copolymers composed by Vinylpyrrolidone (VP) and Butyl Acrylate (BA) monomers. In the first place, the influence of the monomer molar ratio (XVP/YBA) on the copolymer properties was studied. Thus, a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis verified dipole-dipole interactions between amide groups. The influence of these interactions on several parameters related to the molecular mobility was evidenced by the DSC, DRS and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) techniques. Secondly, the effect of the cross-link density on the molecular dynamics of 60VP/40BA copolymers was analyzed using DSC and DRS. One single glass transition was detected by DSC measurements. The DRS analysis showed that an increase of the cross-linking produced a typical effect on the alpha process dynamics. However, the beta process, which possessed typical features of pure JG relaxation, unexpectedly lost the intermolecular character for the highest cross-linker content. The fastest gamma process was relatively unaffected. The second family of polymeric materials studied was a series of segmented polycarbonatediol polyurethane (PUPH) modified with different amounts of expanded graphite (EG) conductive filler. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction measurements and FTIR analysis demonstrated a homogeneous dispersion of the EG filler in the matrix. DRS was used to study the dielectric properties of the PUPH/EG composites. The dielectric permittivity of the composites showed an insulator to conductor percolation transition with the increase of the EG content (2030 wt%). The addition of expanded graphite to the matrix caused a dramatic increase in the electrical conductivity of ten orders of magnitude, which is an indication of percolative behavior.",

Cellulose has been grafted with butyl acrylate via emulsifier free emulsion polymerization using in situ developed transition metal complex initiating system: CuSO4/glycine/ammonium persulfate with and without additive kaolin to prepare nanocomposites and copolymer, respectively. The morphology of so‐prepared grafted nanocomposites was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and field emission scanning electron microscopy.

    "abstract": "Smart materials with multiple shape memory capacities gradually interested a broad mass of researchers due to their potential application in textiles, smart actuators and aerospace engineering. However, the design and sustainable synthesis of multiple shape memory polymers (SMPs) simultaneously possessing robust mechanical strength, reprocessability, reconfigurability still remain full of challenges. Starting from a readily available biomass material cellulose, a well-defined SMPs, cellulose-graft-poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-1-vinylimidazole) copolymer (Cell-g-(BA-co-VI)), was facilely synthesized by addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) and the subsequent metallosupramolecular crosslinking. Taking advantageous of the dynamic bonding, i.e. the rapid reversible fragmentation and the formation of metal ion-imidazole coordination, polymer networks with highly tunable mechanical properties, excellent solid-state plasticity and quadruple-shape memory capacity are handily attainable. Microscopically, the metal-ligand clusters have a strong tendency to phase segregate from soft grafted copolymers indicated by atomic force microscope (AFM), which serving as netpoints to construct novel SMPs. This article represents our new exploration of the next-generation SMPs basing on cellulose backbone where carrying with supramolecular crosslinked soft grafted copolymers. This architecture design allows achieving robust, reprocessable and reconfigurable thermoplastic SMPs that are tough challengingly realized by many other methods. Integrating these properties into one system with a synergetic manner also provides a novel approach to the high value-adding application of cellulose in the fabrication of advanced functional materials.",

    "abstract": "This Research Topic entitled “Self-assembly as a tool for functional materials design” includes an attractive collection of seven (7) manuscripts reporting on the field of softmatter self-assembly. The articles refer to both small and high molecular weight organic molecules that can organize to form hierarchical structures with novel and unusual properties, demonstrating the dynamic nature of the research area and the potential of the self-assembled systems in Material Science. In one of the first examples, by Ding et al. a trimethylammonium functionalized cationic water-soluble pillar[5]arene was described, acting as a supramolecular host for the stabilization of indocyanine green dye. The prepared host-guest assemblies enhanced the stability and photothermal conversion efficiency of the photosensitizer and therefore promoted its anticancer activity. In another interesting study, Tan et al.investigated the assembly of uracilfunctionalized boron-dipyrromethenes which are a promising class of optical dyes whose exceptional optical properties are closely related to their supramolecular structures. Computer simulations have elucidated the molecular interactions leading to the supramolecular assemblies, whereas, the nanotribological properties of the assemblies were determined by atomic force microscopy. In a very novel approach, Sun et al. showed that photoluminescent nanosized quasispherical polymeric assemblies prepared by the hydrothermal reaction of polyacrylonitrile have the ability to photo-induce atom transfer radical polymerization catalyzed by very low, parts per million concentrations of a CuII complex with tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine. The group has used these assemblies to polymerize both acrylate and methacrylate monomers using blue or green light irradiation and have shed light into the mechanistic aspects of the polymerization by linear sweep voltammetry. Another timely study was reported by Salminen et al. who introduced poly(butyl acrylate)-based materials presenting dual, permanent and dynamic, cross-links. The chemical cross-linker provided shape stability to the networks, whereas, toughening was achieved via the dynamic cross-linkers comprising polymerizable salt ions, which presented reversible ionic interactions.

    "abstract": "Investigation of the effects of a solvent on the photophysical and redox properties of the photoredox catalyst (PC), N,N-di(2-naphthyl)-5,10-dihydrophenazine (PC 1), revealed the opportunity to use tetrahydrofuran (THF) to modulate the reactivity of PC 1 toward achieving a controlled organocatalyzed atom transfer radial polymerization (O-ATRP) of acrylates. Compared with dimethylacetamide (DMAc), in tetrahydrofuran (THF), PC 1 exhibits a higher quantum yield of intersystem crossing (ΦISC = 0.02 in DMAc, 0.30 in THF), a longer singlet excited-state lifetime (τ Singlet = 3.81 ns in DMAc, 21.5 ns in THF), and a longer triplet excited-state lifetime (τ Triplet = 4.3 μs in DMAc, 15.2 μs in THF). Destabilization of 1 •+, the proposed polymerization deactivator, in THF leads to an increase in the oxidation potential of this species by 120 mV (E 1/2 0 = 0.22 V vs SCE in DMAc, 0.34 V vs SCE in THF). The O-ATRP of n-butyl acrylate (n-BA) catalyzed by PC 1 proceeds in a more controlled fashion in THF than in DMAc, producing P(n-BA) with low dispersity, Đ (Đ < 1.2). Model reactions and spectroscopic experiments revealed that two initiator-derived alkyl radicals add to the core of PC 1 to form an alkyl-substituted photocatalyst (2) during the polymerization. PC 2 accesses a polar CT excited state that is ~40 meV higher in energy than PC 1 and forms a slightly more oxidizing radical cation (E 1/2 0 = 0.22 V for 1 •+ and 0.25 V for 2 •+ in DMAc). A new O-ATRP procedure was developed wherein PC 1 is converted to 2 in situ. The application of this method enabled the O-ATRP of a number of acrylates to proceed with moderate to good control (Đ = 1.15-1.45 and I* = 83-127%).",

One of the most common pulmonary manifestations is in the form of pulmonary nodules [1]. These patients are at higher risk of recurrent pneumothorax which can get complicated in form of broncho/alveolopleural fistula [2]. This can cause significant increase in morbidity. Here we report a case of recurrent pneumothorax who was diagnosed to have rheumatoid arthritis with multiple pulmonary nodules and the broncho-pleural fistula. She was successfully managed with bronchoscopic intrabronchial cyanoacrylate glue instillation. A 42-year-old female presented to another hospital with history of progressive dyspnoea and right sided pleuritic chest pain of 4 days duration. On evaluation her chest radiograph revealed right sided pneumothorax. She was managed with intercostal drain (ICD) insertion and conservative management. ICD was removed after 7 days as her pneumothorax resolved and there was no evidence of air-leak and she was discharged. Unfortunately, patient reported again after 10 days with similar complaints and further evaluation revealed a recurrent pneumothorax (Figure 1A). ICD reinsertion was done and a persistent air-leak (Cerfolio grade-2) was also identified. During her hospital stay, she complained of pain and progressive swelling of joints of her hands and legs, especially the small joints. On evaluation, she was found to have raised rheumatoid factor levels and anticyclic citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) antibody and was diagnosed to have rheumatoid arthritis and was commenced on disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs. Her contrast enhanced computed tomography of chest showed numerous calcified nodules in bilateral lungs with patchy bronchiectasis and coarse reticulations (Figure 1C). There were features of mosaic attenuation with patchy areas of air-trapping seen in bilateral lungs. She underwent bronchoscopy with 6.0 mm diameter flexible videobronchoscope (2.8 mm channel, Olympus BF-1T150, Olympus Corporation, Japan) which showed unhealthy mucosa in right lower lobe (RLL) bronchus which bled on touch. Broncho-pleural fistula (BPF) was localised by sequential occlusion with balloon occlusion catheter (Fogarty; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) to lateral basal segment of RLL. We decided to close the BPF with cyano acrylate glue. N-butyl cyano acrylate glue was filled in 2 mL syringe under strict dry condition. We used transbronchial needle aspiration needle (21G, 15mm in length, Olympus Corporation, Japan) for delivery of the glue which is otherwise used for diagnostic aspiration from mediastinal lymph nodes. It was inserted through the working channel of the bronchoscope and the glue was instilled under direct observation to the site of leak. We kept the bronchoscope about two centimetres away from the catheter tip to prevent damage to the bronchoscope and we also used additional precaution in form of Fogarty balloon which was inflated between the tip of catheter and the distal tip of scope to prevent any spill of the glue on the scope (Figure 1D).

To this aim, copolymers of varying block lengths, but keeping the P nBA block as a major component, were synthesized. Small-angle x-ray scattering revealed that the copolymers with short PS blocks (∼10 kg/mol) approach an LDOT but do not cross it. At room temperature, these copolymers exhibit higher moduli compared to a P nBA homopolymer due to the reinforcing effect of the PS but are flowing at temperatures above the glass transition of the PS. Increasing the PS and P nBA block length, to keep the same PS fraction, induces more profound changes in the structural and viscoelastic behaviors. Such a copolymer crosses the LDOT, leading to a microphase-separated and ordered state at high temperature. Contrary to the copolymers with short PS blocks, the flow regime was not reached, even at temperatures well above the glass transition of the PS. Instead, a low-frequency plateau was observed in rheology, showing the increased lifetime of the microphase-separated PS domains. ABA triblock copolymers exhibiting an LDOT behavior could, thus, be of interest for the design of thermoplastic elastomers or pressure-sensitive adhesives that can resist the flow at high temperatures.",

The key acrylic monomers (i.e., n-butyl acrylate and acrylic acid) with copolymerizable photoinitiator 4-acrylooxybenzophenone in the presence of a selected chain transfer agent (tetrabromomethane, TBM) were used in the UV-cotelomerization process. Moreover, two kinds of UV-photoinitiators (α-hydroxyalkylphenones, HPs and acylphosphine oxides, APOs) were tested. Photo-DSC, viscosity, thermogravimetric, and GPC measurements for cotelomers were performed. The kinetics study revealed that the systems with APOs, especially Omnirad 819 and Omnirad TPO, were characterized by a much higher reaction rate and greater initiation efficiency than HPs systems were. Additionally, the APO-based syrups exhibited a higher solid content (ca. 60–96 wt%), a higher dynamic viscosity (5–185 Pa·s), but slightly lower molecular weights (Mn and Mw) compared to HP syrups. However, better self-adhesive features (i.e., adhesion and tack) were observed for PSAs based on cotelomers syrups obtained using APOs with lower solid contents (55–80 wt%). It was found that as the solids content (i.e., monomers conversion) increased the adhesion, the tack and glass transition temperature decreased and the type and amount of photoinitiator had no effect on polydispersity.

The CNCs at loadings of up to 1 wt% with respect to monomer resulted in significant and simultaneous improvement in tack, peel strength and shear strength for the PSA films. While most latex properties were unchanged, the CNCs also led to increased latex viscosity. A range of compositions were used to test the limits of the application. Microscopy was used to demonstrate that the CNCs were dispersed throughout the latex but outside of the polymer particles.

    "abstract": "The synthesis of Laponite®-based composite latexes by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-mediated surfactant-free emulsion polymerization is described. RAFT homopolymers and copolymers (macroRAFT agents) comprising acrylic acid (AA), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segments and n-butyl acrylate (BA) repeating units were adsorbed onto exfoliated Laponite® in aqueous dispersion, and subsequently chain extended by methyl methacrylate and BA to form colloidal nanocomposites. The high hydrophilicity of PAA macroRAFT agents led to unstable latexes as polymerization took place mainly in the aqueous phase. Differently, PEG-based RAFT copolymers adsorbed more strongly onto Laponite® and favored morphology control. The free macroRAFT chains engaged preferably in the stabilization of the hybrid structures, rather than in the formation of free latex particles, resulting primarily in a Janus morphology. The presence of BA units in the macroRAFT structure helped further in confining the polymerization on the clay surface and enabled the morphology of the particles to be tuned resulting in the formation of dumbbell or sandwich-like structures. These results show that the parameters driving the competing mechanisms related to the polymerization locus, such as the presence of free macroRAFTs, the affinity between macroRAFTs and clay and the adequate hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance within the macroRAFT structure, are key for assuring both the stabilization of the nanocomposite particles and the control of their morphology.",

    "abstract": "Designing and obtaining new synthetic smart biointerfaces with specific and controlled characteristics relevant for applications in biomedical and bioengineering domains represents one of the main challenges in these fields. In this work, Matrix-Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation (MAPLE) is used to obtain synthetic biointerfaces of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-butyl acrylate) p(NIPAM-BA) copolymer with different characteristics (i.e., roughness, porosity, wettability), and their effect on normal HEK 293 T and murine melanoma B16-F1 cells is studied. For this, the influence of various solvents (chloroform, dimethylsulfoxide, water) and fluence variation (250–450 mJ/cm2) on the morphological, roughness, wettability, and physico–chemical characteristics of the coatings are evaluated by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, contact angle measurements, Fourier-transform-IR spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Coatings obtained by the spin coating method are used for reference. No significant alteration in the chemistry of the surfaces is observed for the coatings obtained by both methods. All p(NIPAM-BA) coatings show hydrophilic character, with the exception of those obtained with chloroform at 250 mJ/cm2. The surface morphology is shown to depend on both solvent type and laser fluence and it ranges from smooth surfaces to rough and porous ones. Physico–chemical and biological analysis reveal that the MAPLE deposition method with fluences of 350–450 mJ/cm2 when using DMSO solvent is more appropriate for bioengineering applications due to the surface characteristics (i.e., pore presence) and to the good compatibility with normal cells and cytotoxicity against melanoma cells.",

After healing at 60 °C for 24 h, the strength and elongation at break of the repaired sample recovered to 97.2% and 95.4% of the original values, respectively. Importantly, the BVn based elastomers relied on π–π stacking interactions between imidazole groups rather than covalent crosslinks and could be recycled.

The bottlebrush polymers spontaneously bloom to both the air and substrate interfaces during solution casting. While neat PS films are hydrophobic and poorly adhere to the native oxide on clean silicon wafers, the hydrophilicity and substrate adherence of bottlebrush-incorporating PS films can be tailored through the thermally activated deprotection of tBA to produce acrylic acid (AA) and acrylic anhydride (AH). A critical design parameter is the manner by which tBA is incorporated into the bottlebrush: When the bottlebrush side chains are copolymers of S and tBA, the extent of deprotection is extremely low, even after prolonged thermal annealing at elevated temperature. However, when the bottlebrush contains a mixture of poly(t-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) and PS side chains, nearly all tBA is converted to AA and AH. Consequently, using the \"mixed-chain\" bottlebrush design with thermal processing and appropriate conditioning, the water contact angle is reduced from over 90° on unmodified PS down to 75° on bottlebrush-incorporating PS films, and the substrate adherence is improved in proportion to the extent of tBA deprotection.",

The silanization was optimized in terms of shell thickness and particle size distribution, and the obtained materials were investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Subsequently, the free radical polymerization of different monomers (tert-butyl acrylate (tBA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), styrene, 2-vinyl pyridine (2VP), and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm)) was examined in the presence of the thiol-modified nanoparticles. During the process, a covalently anchored polymeric shell was formed and the resulting core–shell hybrid materials were analyzed in terms of size (DLS, TEM), shell thickness (TGA, TEM), and the presence of functional groups (attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR)). Hereby, the shell leads to a different solution behavior of the particles and in some cases an increased stability towards acids. Moreover, we examined the influence of the nanoparticle concentration during polymerization and we found a significant influence on dispersity of the resulting polymers.

    "abstract": "The design of anode-free batteries presents an attractive approach to the lithium metal battery. However, challenges such as uneven plating of lithium and poor Coulombic efficiency limit their commercially viable applications. In response to these challenges, this study introduces poly{(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid)-co-(butyl acrylate)} (PAMPS-co-PBA), an artificial interface engineered to enhance the cyclic stability of batteries by fortifying the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and enabling self-healing and single-ion conductivity. Synthesis outcomes, validated by FTIR and 1H NMR spectra, demonstrate successful production of PAMPS-co-PBA. Experimental results, including analyses of surface morphology, tensile strength, and Li plating/stripping tests, demonstrate the effectiveness of PAMPS-co-PBA in preventing dendrite formation and achieving >99% Coulombic efficiency. SEM analysis reveals better surface morphology and minimal lithium deposits for PAMPS-co-PBA compared with bare copper and other alternative interfaces. XPS analysis confirms the self-healing and single-ion conducting attributes of PAMPS-co-PBA postcycling. Density functional theory calculations elucidates the interface’s behavior, confirming a pathway for Li-ion movement facilitated by the sulfonic acid group. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations highlight the potential for SEI formation, shedding light on the influence of LiTFSI on interface protection. Anode-free full cell testing demonstrates PAMPS-co-PBA enhancement in stability over bare copper, with 1.6 times capacity retention over 50 cycles, primarily attributed to self-healing and dendrite suppression. Nonetheless, observed capacity fading after prolonged cycling suggests the optimization of Li salt choice.

In this work, a deterministic multi-dimensional Smith-Ewart model is combined with a method of moments model for nitroxide (N-(2-methyl-2-propyl)-N-(1-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethylpropyl)-N-oxyl; SG1) mediated polymerization (NMP) of n-butyl acrylate in miniemulsion. This model accounts for reaction and phase transfer, to showcase for the first time seven instead of three kinetic regimes in a broad d\n                     p range from 5 to 300 nm. The reliability of the model prediction is high because of (i) successful model validation under miniemulsion conditions at 385 K; (ii) unique consideration of β-scission, allowing realistic prediction of the livingness; (iii) a validated temperature dependent SG1 partitioning coefficient; and (iv) many kinetic model parameters sourced from independent experimental validation under bulk/solution conditions.

    "abstract": "Improving water-based polymer`s properties using silicon compounds is strongly noticed nowadays. A novel siloxane-based crosslink agent was synthesized using oligomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) hydroxyl-terminated. The crosslinker was used for emulsion copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA), butyl acrylate (BA), and acrylic acid (AA). Incorporation of the crosslinker in the structure of the copolymer increased the average latex particle size (from about 165 to 207 nm) and as a result, the viscosity of the latexes was dramatically decreased (from 212 cP to 83 cP). The crosslink density of the latexes, meanwhile, was raised (from about 7–60%). Electrostatic stability of the latexes was improved in the presence of the crosslinker (zeta potential from − 31.7 mV to -49.5 mV and the average mobility of the latexes particles from − 2.4 μm/s/V/cm to -3.8 μm/s/V/cm). The crosslinking agent affected both the initial decomposition temperature and residual weight fraction of the copolymer (from 353 to 406 °C and from about 0.5 w% to 12.4 w% respectively). A morphological study of the latexes was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. The addition of the crosslinker, led to a decrease in the contact angle (from 70 to 39 degrees) of the latexes film formed.",

Compared with the previously reported C-bridged phosphine-ketone Pd(II) and Ni(II) catalysts as references, these N-bridged phosphine-amide catalysts showed obviously enhanced molecular weights, which reach a 200 times higher value of 83.2 kg mol−1 that is comparable to those using pioneering bisphosphine-monoxide P^O catalysts. More significantly, not only preferred cationic Pd(II) catalysts but also the more challenging Ni(II) catalysts enabled ethylene copolymerizations with challenging polar vinyl monomers such as methyl acrylate, acrylic acid, and n-butyl vinyl ether with good catalytic activities, molecular weights (14.1 kg mol−1), and comonomer incorporation (3.3 mol%).

In this article we show that transfer to polymer impacts uniquely on the kinetics and microstructure of poly(n-butyl acrylate) synthesized by microemulsion polymerization where the polymer chains are confined to a small volume. Intramolecular transfer to polymer results in a distinctive kinetic profile with a maximum in the rate of conversion at ≈25% monomer conversion in batch microemulsion polymerizations, and this effect is explained by development of a mathematical model. Furthermore, the importance of intermolecular transfer to polymer in seeded microemulsion polymerizations is explored. It is shown that intermolecular transfer to polymer followed by termination reactions lead to the majority of chains in each individual particle being linked together. However, because of the small size of the particles formed in microemulsion polymerization, a limit on the maximum molecular weight of the polymer prevents formation of gel, and allows for control over the polymer microstructure. Finally, we show that this control over microstructure can be used to tune the adhesive properties of films cast from the latex dispersions.",

PtBA homopolymers with well‐defined structure and controlled molecular weight in a wide range were successfully synthesized via radiation‐induced reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in the presence of a trithiocarbonate type RAFT agent. The polymerization of tBA was performed under 60Co γ‐irradiation in the presence of 2‐(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)‐2‐methylpropionic acid (DDMAT) as the RAFT agent in toluene at room temperature with three [tBA]/[DDMAT] ratios (400, 600 and 1000) and different irradiation times. Radiation‐induced polymerization of tBA displayed controlled free radical polymerization characteristics: a narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn ~ 1.1), pseudo first order kinetics and controlled molecular weights. The system followed the RAFT polymerization mechanism even at very low amounts of RAFT agent ([tBA]/[DDMAT] = 1000), and molecular weights up to 113 900 with narrow dispersity (Ð =1.06) were obtained. PtBA was further hydrolysed into different amphiphilic PtBA‐co‐poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) copolymers by low (27.5%) and high (77.3%) degrees of hydrolysis. The pH sensitivity of the two copolymers was investigated by dynamic light scattering at pH 2 and pH 9 (above and below the pKa value of PAA) and their hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potential values were determined. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry",

The purpose of this paper is to prepare self-crosslinking fluorocarbon polyacrylate latexes containing different fluorocarbon chain lengths by semi-continuous seeded emulsion polymerization technology.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nMethyl methacrylate (MMA), butyl acrylate (BA), hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) and fluorine-containing monomers were used as main monomers. The fluorine-containing monomers included hexafluorobutyl methacrylate (HFMA), dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate (DFMA) and trifluorooctyl methacrylate (TFMA). Potassium persulfate (KPS) was used as thermal decomposition initiator, non-ionic surfactant alkyl alcohol polyoxyethylene (25) ether (DNS-2500) and anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) as mixed emulsifier.\n\n\nFindings\nThrough optimizing the reaction conditions, the uniform and stable latex is gained. The polymer of structure was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and contact angle (CA) were tested on latex films. The particle size and distribution range of emulsion were tested with nano particle size analyzer. After comprehensively comparing the latexes and films prepared by HFMA, DFMA and TFMA, the performance of DFMA monomer modified is better.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe self-crosslinking acrylic emulsion is prepared via semi-continuous seeded emulsion polymerization, which methyl methacrylate (MMA), butyl acrylate (BA), hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) and fluorine-containing monomers were used as main monomers.

    "abstract": "Thermosets composed of cross-linked polymers demonstrate enhanced thermal, solvent, chemical, and dimensional stability as compared to their non-cross-linked counterparts. However, these often-desirable material properties typically come at the expense of reprocessability, recyclability, and healability. One solution to this challenge comes from the construction of polymers that are reversibly cross-linked. We relied on lessons from Nature to present supramolecular polymer networks comprised of cooperative Janus-faced hydrogen bonded cross-links. A triazine-based guanine-cytosine base (GCB) with two complementary faces capable of self-assembly through three hydrogen bonding sites was incorporated into poly(butyl acrylate) to create a reprocessable and recyclable network. Rheological experiments and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were employed to investigate the flow behavior of copolymers with randomly distributed GCB units of varying incorporation. Our studies revealed that the cooperativity of multiple hydrogen bonding faces yields excellent network integrity evidenced by a rubbery plateau that spanned the widest temperature range yet reported for any supramolecular network. To verify that each Janus-faced motif engages in multiple cross-links, we studied the effects of local concentration of the incorporated GCB units within the polymer chain. Mechanical strength improved by colocalizing the GCB within a block copolymer morphology. This enhanced performance revealed that the number of effective cross-links in the network increased with the local concentration of hydrogen bonding units. Overall, this study demonstrates that cooperative noncovalent interactions introduced through Janus-faced hydrogen bonding moieties confers excellent network stability and predictable viscoelastic flow behavior in supramolecular networks.",

The particles were synthesized by RAFT emulsion polymerization using oligo(acrylic acid‐block‐styrene) RAFT as a reactive surfactant. Coherent hybrid films could be formed when the particles possessed a relatively thick soft PnBA shell (core–shell ratio = 1:1 or 3:7) without adding any coalescing agent even when 15 wt% MMT was added. TEM observations revealed that around 20 nm thick clay stacks were well dispersed throughout the hybrid films. Increasing the levels of PS or MMT could much increase the modulus and tensile strength of the hybrid films. However, simply increasing PS composition would be limited by the crack formation and brittleness of the resultant films. The ternary hybrid design would allow one to gain good balance between mechanical properties and coherent film formation. The enhancing efficiency of MMT for the modulus and tensile strength was much higher when placing the clay stacks in PS domains than in PBA domains, which was particularly obvious when MMT levels were higher than 10 wt%.",

The main component in KHI formulations is a water-soluble polymer with many amphiphilic groups, usually made up of amide groups and adjacent hydrophobic groups with 3–6 carbon atoms. KHI polymers are one of the most expensive oilfield production chemicals. Therefore, methods to make cheaper but effective KHIs could improve the range of applications. Continuing earlier work from our group with maleic-based polymers, here, we explore maleic acid/alkyl acrylate copolymers as potential low-cost KHIs. Performance experiments were conducted under high pressure with a structure II-forming natural gas mixture in steel rocking cells using the slow (1 °C/h) constant cooling test method. Under typical pipeline conditions of pH (4–6), the performance of the maleic acid/alkyl acrylate copolymers (alkyl = iso-propyl, iso-butyl, n-butyl, tetrahydrofurfuryl, and cyclohexyl) was poor. However, good performance was observed at very high pH (13–14) due to the thermodynamic effect from added salts in the aqueous phase and the removal of CO2 from the gas phase. A methyl maleamide/n-butyl acrylate copolymer gave very poor performance, giving evidence that direct bonding of the hydrophilic amide and C4 hydrophobic groups is needed for good KHI performance. Reaction of the maleic anhydride (MA) units in MA/alkyl acrylate 1:1 copolymers with dibutylaminopropylamine or dibutylaminoethanol gave polymers with good KHI performance, with MA/tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate being the best. Oxidation of the pendant dibutylamino groups to amine oxide groups improved the performance further, better than poly(N-vinyl caprolactam).",

    "abstract": "Cationic latexes with Tgs ranging between -40 °C and 120 °C were synthesised using n-butyl acrylate (BA) and/or methyl methacrylate (MMA) as the core polymers. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) combined with polymerisation-induced self-assembly (PISA) allowed for in situ chain-extension of a cationic macromolecular RAFT agent (macroRAFT) of poly(N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] methacrylamide) (PDMAPMA), used as stabiliser in so-called surfactant-free emulsion polymerisation. The resulting narrowly distributed nanosized latexes adsorbed readily onto silica surfaces and to model surfaces of cellulose nanofibrils, as demonstrated by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) measurements. Adsorption to anionic surfaces increased when increasing ionic strength to 10 mM, indicating the influence of the polyelectrolyte effect exerted by the corona. The polyelectrolyte corona affected the interactions in the wet state, the stability of the latex and re-dispersibility after drying. The QCM-D measurements showed that a lower Tg of the core results in a more strongly interacting adsorbed layer at the solid-liquid interface, despite a comparable adsorbed mass, indicating structural differences of the investigated latexes in the wet state. The two latexes with Tg below room temperature (i.e. PBATg-40 and P(BA-co-MMA)Tg3) exhibited film formation in the wet state, as shown by AFM colloidal probe measurements. It was observed that P(BA-co-MMA)Tg3 latex resulted in the largest pull-off force, above 200 m Nm-1 after 120 s in contact. The strongest wet adhesion was achieved with PDMAPMA-stabilized latexes soft enough to allow for interparticle diffusion of polymer chains, and stiff enough to create a strong adhesive joint. Fundamental understanding of interfacial properties of latexes and cellulose enables controlled and predictive strategies to produce strong and tough materials with high nanocellulose content, both in the wet and dry state.",

    "abstract": "Smart textiles, which respond to external stimuli, have a wide range of applications, from protective gear to wearable electronics. Among textile materials, leather stands out for its high tear strength and flexibility. However, challenges in imparting conductivity to leather include leftover dopant metal ions and additives from in situ polymerization, poor dispersion of presynthesized conductive polymers, and nondegradability of conductive or matrix materials. In this work, we developed two degradable nanoparticles (NP1 (diameter = 120 nm) and NP2 (diameter = 245 nm)) using a castor oil-based cross-linker, butyl acrylate, and acrylic acid. These cross-linked nanoparticles effectively dispersed polypyrrole (PPy) and exhibited conductivities of 4.69 × 10-4 and 5.57 × 10-4 S/cm for PPy-NP1- and PPy-NP2-coated leather, respectively. A nearly 2-fold increase in conductivity was observed for the nanoparticle-dispersed coating (PPy-NP1) compared to the non-nanoparticle polymer coating (PPy-Pol). Beyond conductivity, the nanoparticle-based coating enhanced leather's surface hydrophobicity and resistance to E. coli and B. subtilis bacteria. We also demonstrated the degradability of the nanoparticle and the recovery of PPy (nearly 30%). The coated materials were tested for thermal and physical stability by using TGA, DSC, and rub fastness tests. To showcase real-world applications, we developed a prototype glove and tested its touchscreen responsiveness. The glove exhibited excellent touchscreen responsiveness and the material exhibited strong physical and thermal stability (Tg and Tini = -6.0 to 228.5 °C, respectively) and reliable performance in low temperatures, making it ideal for conductive surfaces on protective gear in cold environments.",

Stable gel emulsions were formed using aqueous phase fractions (APFs) ranging from 10 to 90 vol%. Creaming, flocculation and coalescence were not observed. Low‐temperature polymerization of the gel emulsions with a redox initiator gave the corresponding low‐density, highly porous poly(n‐butyl acrylate)s (PBAs). The microstructures of the PBAs were observed using scanning electron microscopy. All the porous PBAs comprised numerous spherical structures whose sizes could be controlled by adjusting the gel emulsion APF. The densities and porosities of the porous PBAs decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing APF. The absorption capacities of the porous PBAs in organic solvents were studied. The porous PBAs selectively absorbed kerosene from water instantly and the kerosene could then be recovered by physical compression of the PBAs. Further porous polymers were prepared from gel emulsions containing styrene, methyl methacrylate (MMA) or 2‐ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA) as continuous oil phases. The order of absorption capacity and swelling ratio in kerosene was poly(EHA) &gt; PBA ≫ poly(MMA).

RE-RAFT of tert-butyl acrylate (TBA) was performed to yield a mixture of polymers exhibiting a bimodal size exclusion chromatography (SEC) trace. Both the peak top molecular weights shifted to higher-molecular-weight regions as the monomer conversion increased. The structure of the resulting polymer mixture was examined by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF-MS. Detailed studies indicated that the obtained polymer of higher molecular weight was one of the large-sized cyclic polymers generated by the fusion of smaller-sized cyclic polymers during the RE-RAFT polymerization process.

Kinetic experiments were conducted to demonstrate that Cu(0) wire-catalyzed single electron transfer-living radical polymerization (SET-LRP) in alcohols at 25 °C provides a green methodology for the LRP of this forgotten class of biobased monomers. The acrylic derivative of ethyl lactate (EL) solvent and homologous structures with methyl and n-butyl ester were polymerized with excellent control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and chain-end functionality. Kinetics plots in conventional alcohols such as ethanol and methanol were first order in the monomer, with molecular weight increasing linearly with conversion. However, aqueous EL mixtures were found to be more suitable than pure EL to mediate the SET-LRP process. The near-quantitative monomer conversion and high bromine chain-end functionality, demonstrated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis, further allowed the preparation of innovative biobased block copolymers containing rubbery poly(ethyl lactate acrylate) poly(ELA) sequences.

The polyaspartic-polyol mixtures reacted with polyisocyanates to create hybrid polyurethane-polyaspartic hybrid coatings. Different amounts of synthesized acrylic copolymer (5, 10, and 20% of total resin mixture) were mixed into polyaspartic resin and subsequently reacted with polyisocyanates in a 1:1 molar ratio. The characterization of the polymer was performed with Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), Fourier-Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The determination of physical and mechanical properties of the hybrid coatings was accomplished by hardness, glossiness, abrasion, stress-strain, corrosion, and impact tests. The results indicated that by adding high solids acrylic copolymer (HSAC), the drawbacks of polyaspartic resin (short pot life, hardness and brittleness, and poor adhesiveness) have been largely eliminated without reducing its intrinsic properties. The pot life increased from 16 minutes to 27 minutes and shore D hardness decreased from 60-65 to 52-55 as the polyol content increased in the mixtures.

Additionally, the CIS particles can be loaded upon extrusion or chemically by a postfunctionalization strategy with organic dyes implying pH-responsive features.

We find that the initially incorporated water induces polymer-dependent phase separation, facilitating further water uptake. For the blood-compatible polymer, tetrahedrally coordinated water coexists with water adsorbed on C═O groups in low-density regions of the grafted polymer surface, providing a scaffold for the formation of intermediate water. The amount of intermediate water is determined by the type of functional groups, local polymer configuration, and polymer morphology.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Herein, we describe a one-step method for synthesizing cationic acrylate-based core-shell latex (CACS latex), which is used to prepare architectural coatings with excellent antimicrobial properties. Firstly, a polymerizable water-soluble quaternary ammonium salt (QAS-BN) was synthesized using 2-(Dimethylamine) ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and benzyl bromide by the Hoffman alkylation reaction. Then QAS-BN, butyl acrylate (BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES) as reactants and 2,2’-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AIBA) as a water-soluble initiator were used to synthesize the CACS latex. The effect of the QAS-BN dosage on the properties of the emulsion and latex film was systematically investigated. The TGA results showed that using QAS-BN reduced the latex film’s initial degradation temperature but improved its thermal stability. In the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) photographs, the self-stratification of latex particles with a high dosage of QAS-BN was observed, forming a core-shell structure of latex particles. The DSC, TGA, XPS, SEM, and performance tests confirmed the core-shell structure of the latex particles. The relationship between the formation of the core-shell structure and the content of QAS-BN was proved. The formation of the core-shell structure was due to the preferential reaction of water-soluble monomers in the aqueous phase, which led to the aggregation of hydrophilic groups, resulting in the formation of soft-core and hard-shell latex particles. However, the water resistance of the films formed by CACS latex was greatly reduced. We introduced a p-chloromethyl styrene and n-hexane diamine (p-CMS/EDA) crosslinking system, effectively improving the water resistance in this study. Finally, the antimicrobial coating was prepared with a CACS emulsion of 7 wt.% QAS-BN and 2 wt.% p-CMS/EDA. The antibacterial activity rates of this antimicrobial coating against E. coli and S. aureus were 99.99%. The antiviral activity rates against H3N2, HCoV-229E, and EV71 were 99.4%, 99.2%, and 97.9%, respectively. This study provides a novel idea for the morphological design of latex particles.

The continuous optimization requires the understanding of the ion transport in available materials. In this work, a group of ammonium-based acrylate polyILs were examined as the candidates with engineered side chains containing long linker and various alkyl tails. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the mechanism of ion transport. For all simulated systems, the diffusion coefficients were higher than previously investigated polyILs with imidazolium vinyl cations directly bonded to the backbones. Diffusivity was further improved when the tail length increased from methyl to propyl, but this trend did not persist for butyl and longer tails. The higher diffusion coefficient generally coexisted with less ion pair association, lower dynamical heterogeneity, and suppressed string-like cooperative motion. It was affirmed that only a few counterions were fast-moving for effective hopping, and the counterions exhibited smoother motion in acrylate polyILs than the imidazolium- based polyIL with a shorter side chain. For better ion transport, this work suggested that long linker and intermediate tails in the polymerized ions appeared to be the attractive candidates.",

The kinetics of miktoarm star polymer adsorption from the oil phase depended on the polymer concentration. This suggested that the rate-determining step was the adsorption and penetration of the polymer onto and through the interface. This was attributed to the desolvation of the polymer arms from the oil phase being less facile than that of similar star polymers with PEO arms alone from the aqueous phase. PEO star polymers showed diffusion-controlled kinetics, and as such, the adsorption and so forth were facile and rapid compared to the rate of diffusion to the interface. The interfacial oscillatory dilatational rheology of the polymers adsorbed at the interface was dependent on the relative molecular weights or lengths of the arms. In the case where both arms showed similar contour lengths, the interfacial rheological response was strongly frequency dependent, suggesting that the polymer adsorption/desorption was relatively facile on the time scale of the oscillation. Polymers in which the hydrophilic arms were longer than the hydrophobic arms showed a relatively frequency-independent response. This was attributed to the hydrophobic arms effectively increasing the size of the hydrophobic core in conjunction with the penetration of the hydrophilic arms through the interface into the aqueous phase, thus pinning the polymer at the interface.",

The (meth)acrylate copolymer [including P (BA–MMA) and P (BA–MMA–HEMA)] films are hydrolyzed in an aqueous solution of NaOH and the transformation of surface chemical composition is achieved by hydrolysis in NaOH solution.

However, the use of [Mn(CHF2)(CO)5] and [Mn(CH2CF3)(CO)5] as radical initiators produced PVDF in a very low yield (0 to 7%) by both thermal and photochemical initiations, while [Mn(COCF2CH3)(CO)5] led to the formation of PVDF in a moderate yield (7% to 23%). Nevertheless, complexes [Mn(CH2CF3)(CO)5] and [Mn(COCHF2)(CO)5] efficiently initiated the alternating VAc/MAF-TBE copolymerization. All synthesized polymers were characterized by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy, which proves the formation of the expected PVDF or poly(VAc-alt-MAF-TBE) and showing the chaining defects and the end-groups in the case of PVDF. The kinetics of VDF homopolymerization showed a linear ln[M]0/[M] versus time relationship, but a decrease of molar masses vs. VDF conversion was noted in all cases, which shows the absence of control. These PVDFs were rather thermally stable in air (up to 410 °C), especially for those having the highest molar masses. The melting points ranged from 164 to 175 °C while the degree of crystallinity varied from 44% to 53%.",

The zwitterionic monomer (ZM) 3-[(3-Acrylamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propane-1-sulfonate (A3361) was selected for the synthesis of 30 wt% emulsifier-free methyl methacrylate/n-butyl acrylate (MMA/n-BA) polymer latex. Three pH conditions were examined: neutral, where the zwitterionic chains are in a collapsed state, and acidic and basic, where these chains adopt an extended conformation, leading to the anti-polyelectrolyte effect. The study of the anti-polyelectrolyte phenomenon on colloidal stability was challenging due to the increased ionic strength in the dispersions. Nevertheless, films cast from the acidic latex demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties, water resistance, and humidity barrier compared to films produced at neutral pH. This improvement is attributed to the anti-polyelectrolyte phenomenon, where the extended polymer chains rich in zwitterions offer enhanced ionic complexation, resulting in a denser and thicker ionic complexed network within the MMA/n-BA matrix. Under basic pH conditions, these improvements were modest, indicating that the anti-polyelectrolyte mechanism is influenced by pH. Furthermore, the high incorporation of A3361 facilitated, for the first time, the synthesis of 50% solids content emulsifier-free latexes, highlighting practical importance of this technology.",

The kinetic inhibition performances of PVCap-co-TBA on the formations of both structure I methane hydrate and structure II natural gas hydrate were investigated by measuring the onset times of hydrate formation under different conditions and compared with commercial KHIs such as PVP, PVCap and inhibex 501. The results indicated that PVCap-co-TBA outperformed these widely applied inhibitors for both structure I and structure II hydrates. At the same dosage of KHI, the maximum tolerable degree of subcooling under which the onset time of hydrate formation exceeded 24 hours for structure I hydrate was much lower than that for structure II hydrate. The inhibition strength increased with the increasing dosage of PVCap-co-TBA; The maximum tolerable degree of subcooling for the natural gas hydrate is more than 10 K when the dosage was higher than 0.5% (mass) while it achieved 12 K when that dosage rose to 0.75% (mass). Additionally, we found polypropylene glycol could be used as synergist at the dosage of 1.0 % (mass) or so, under which the kinetic inhibition performance of PVCap-co-TBA could be improved significantly.

Results indicated that the ultrasound pulses in the first minutes of polymerization increase instant free radical to monomer ratio as well mixing efficiency which led to higher monomer conversion, improved polymerization rate (especially at first 15 min of the reaction), and remarkable decrease in molecular weight distribution. Transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed that the particle size and particle size distribution were significantly affected, particle size decreased, and more uniform particles were obtained. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis also showed that the initiator concentration affected glass transition temperature (Tg) of the final copolymers and in the case of ultrasound‐assisted emulsion polymerization Tg was in a very good agreement with theoretical predictions for copolymerization.

This has been previously achieved by using CuCl/L in the equimolar amount to Pn -Br MI in the chain extension step. However, this approach cannot be effectively applied in systems based on regeneration of activators (ARGET ATRP), since they operate with ppm amounts of catalysts. Herein, a catalytic halogen exchange procedure is reported using a catalytic amount of Cu in miniemulsion ARGET ATRP to chain-extend from a less active poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) MI to a more active methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer. Influence of different reagents on the initiation efficiency and dispersity is studied. Addition of 0.1 m NaCl or tetraethylammonium chloride to ATRP of MMA initiated by methyl 2-bromopropionate leads to high initiation efficiency and polymers with low dispersity.

Here, the styrene-n-butyl acrylate (S/BA) system was polymerized by means of a semicontinuous emulsion process, varying the composition of the comonomer feed to obtain forced composition copolymers (FCCs). Five different feeding profiles were used, searching for a scheme to obtain chains rich in S (looking for considerable modulus), and chains rich in BA (looking for large deformation) as a technique to achieve synergy in copolymer properties; the mechanostatic and dynamic characterization discloses the correspondence between WCD and the bulk properties. 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) analysis enabled the determination of the cumulative copolymer composition characterization, required to estimate the WCD. The static test (stress-strain) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were performed following normed procedures. This is the first report that shows very diverse mechanostatic performances of copolymers obtained using the same chemical system and global comonomer composition, forming a comprehensive failure envelope, even though the tests were carried out at the same temperature and cross head speed.

Since the length of the alkyl chains of the ester groups would significantly influence the polarities of the carbonyl groups and hydrogen bonding effect, we carefully discuss the influence of polarity and hydrogen bonding effect on the dielectric properties and mechanical properties of the modified polybutadienes. Very interestingly, we find that the increment of dielectric constant of PB modified by carboxyl groups is the lowest one compared to other modified PBs with the ester groups. Meanwhile, the modified PBs with the ester groups could achieve pretty low dielectric loss factor. And finally, a high dielectric constant (3.6), low dielectric loss factor (0.0005) and large actuated strain (∼25%) of the modified polybutadienes could be achieved by the modified PBs with butyl acrylate groups.

In this study, the surface treatment agent (STA) for DGIP, which improved the color strength, wet-rubbing fastness of cotton, and STA dispersion stability characteristics, was enhanced by controlling the butyl-acrylate (BA, soft segment) and the vinyl-acetate (VA, rigid segment) ratios. The wet-rubbing fastness improved as the BA ratio increased though the color strength and ink sharpness properties deteriorated. The total K/S color strength of the surface-treated cotton using the BA30 condition was improved by 30% wet rubbing fastness class 3–4 than neat cotton, and the ink smearing phenomenon was verified to decrease. Ultimately, an optimal STA condition was established by adjusting the ratio of BA and VA wt% where the DGIP characteristics of printed cotton verified that these were the simplest parameters to adjust for optimal impact.",

    "abstract": "One of the most fascinating challenges in recent years has been to produce mechanically robust and tough polymers with smart functions such as self-healing and shape-memory behavior. Here, we report a simple and versatile strategy for the preparation of a highly tough and highly stretchable interconnected interpenetrating polymer network (c-IPN) based on butyl rubber (IIR) and poly(n-octadecyl acrylate) (PC18A) with thermally induced healing and shape-memory functions. Solvent-free UV polymerization of n-octadecyl acrylate (C18A) at 30 ± 2 °C in the presence of IIR leads to IIR/PC18A c-IPNs with sea-island or co-continuous morphologies depending on their IIR contents. The lamellar crystals with a melting temperature Tm of 51-52 °C formed by side-by-side packed octadecyl (C18) side chains are responsible for more than 99% of effective cross-links in c-IPNs, the rest being hydrophobic associations and chemical cross-links. The c-IPNs exhibit varying stiffness (9-34 MPa), stretchability (72-740%), and a significantly higher toughness (1.9-12 MJ·m-3) than their components, which can be tuned by changing the IIR/PC18A weight ratio. The properties of c-IPNs could also be tuned by incorporating a second, noncrystallizable hydrophobic monomer, namely, lauryl methacrylate (C12M), in the melt mixture. We show that the lamellar clusters acting as sacrificial bonds break at the yield point by dissipation of energy, while the ductile amorphous continuous phase keeps the structure together, leading to the toughness improvement of c-IPNs. They exhibit a two-step healing process with >90% healing efficiency with respect to the modulus and a complete shape-recovery ratio induced by heating above Tm of alkyl crystals. The temperature-induced healing occurs via a quick step where C18 bridges form between the damaged surfaces followed by a slow step controlled by the interdiffusion of C18A segments in the bulk. We also show that the strategy developed here is suitable for a variety of rubbers and n-alkyl (meth)acrylates of various side-chain lengths.",

    "abstract": "Photonic balls can be facilely obtained through interfacial self-assembly of amphiphilic bottlebrush block polymers (BBCPs) within a water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) multiple emulsion system, and polystyrene (PS) has been employed as the skeleton of the balls showing no responsive properties. Here, we demonstrate the design and synthesis of core-shell BBCPs with a poly(tert-butyl acrylate)-block-polystyrene (PtBA-b-PS) block copolymer as the hydrophobic side chains and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the hydrophilic block. Interfacial self-assembly of the core-shell BBCPs within shrinking droplets produces porous microspheres with full-spectrum structural colors through an organized spontaneous emulsification (OSE) process. The PtBA core wrapped by PS in the skeleton of the balls can be converted into polyacrylic acid (PAA) forming an ionic channel responsive to pH variations. Consequently, the hydrolyzed photonic balls show different colors under different pH conditions dependent on varied degrees of ionization and hydration of the PAA channel. Reflected colors can be verified using an optical spectrometer, providing an effective strategy for precise pH indication. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Non-swelling hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acrylate) network (cPnBA) is a candidate material for synthetic vascular grafts owing to its low toxicity and tailorable mechanical properties. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell type for accelerating endothelialization because of their superior anti-thrombosis and immune modulatory function. Further, they can differentiate into smooth muscle cells or endothelial-like cells and secret pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). MSCs are sensitive to the substrate mechanical properties, with the alteration of their major cellular behavior and functions as a response to substrate elasticity. Here, we cultured human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) on cPnBAs with different mechanical properties (cPnBA250, Young’s modulus (E) = 250 kPa; cPnBA1100, E = 1100 kPa) matching the elasticity of native arteries, and investigated their cellular response to the materials including cell attachment, proliferation, viability, apoptosis, senescence and secretion. The cPnBA allowed high cell attachment and showed negligible cytotoxicity. F-actin assembly of hADSCs decreased on cPnBA films compared to classical tissue culture plate. The difference of cPnBA elasticity did not show dramatic effects on cell attachment, morphology, cytoskeleton assembly, apoptosis and senescence. Cells on cPnBA250, with lower proliferation rate, had significantly higher VEGF secretion activity. These results demonstrated that tuning polymer elasticity to regulate human stem cells might be a potential strategy for constructing stem cell-based artificial blood vessels.",

The obtained latices exhibited Bragg diffraction because of the narrow particle size distribution. Owing to the low dosage of emulsifiers and the crosslinking reaction between the epoxy group and the carboxyl group, the latex films displayed excellent water resistance, with water adsorption as low as 7.1%. The tensile test, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) test, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) indicated that at a GMA dosage of 4–6% the latex films had high mechanical strengths, which remained relatively stable in the temperature range of 10 to 40 °C. The optimal AA dosage was found in the range of 2 to 3%, at which the wet mixture exhibited good processability, conducive to forming an EFFT with a compact microstructure. Using the optimal SA latex, the obtained EFFT displayed a series of improved performances, including low water absorption, high mechanical strength, and stable self-supporting ability over a wide temperature range, exhibiting the application potential in the decoration and construction industries.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Tumor targeting has revolutionized cancer research, especially active cellular targeting of nanoparticles where they are specifically homed to pathological site to deliver the therapeutics. This strategy which involves the utilization of affinity ligands on the surface of the nano-carriers minimizes the non-specific uptake of the nano-carriers and the subsequent harmful side effects in healthy cells. Estrone, one of the mammalian estrogens, has affinity for estrogen receptors (ERα) which are over-expressed in hormone-responsive breast cancers. Despite holding promise, the potential of estrone in active targeting of nanoparticles has barely been explored. Herein, we developed estrone appended poly-ion complex (PIC) micelle to deliver melittin, a cytotoxic peptide, to breast cancer cells. Amino functionalization of estrone was performed to conjugate estrone to the di-block polymer synthesized by RAFT polymerization. Estrone conjugated polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate-b-poly tert-butyl methacrylate (POEGMEMA-PtBuMA) could complex with melittin to form PIC micelles of size around 60 nm ensuing from the electrostatic interaction of the deprotected polymer and melittin in aqueous media. Polyethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate-b-poly acrylic acid (POEGMEA-PAA) was also later incorporated to afford PIC micelles that could exhibit similar cytotoxicity as free melittin in the cytotoxicity studies. The estrone attached PIC micelles exhibited improved cytotoxicity in 2D and 3D cellular models of MCF-7 cells. Crosslinking of the PIC micelles was also performed to improve the stability of the micelles and prevent melittin degradation from enzymatic attack. Flow cytometry demonstrated an enhanced cellular uptake greater than 6-fold with the estrone conjugated PIC micelles thereby establishing a profound difference in the targeting efficacy of the PIC micelles between MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells. Furthermore, the distribution of the PIC micelles in the spheroids was revealed by light sheet microscopy. The results demonstrate the potential of estrone anchored PIC micelles for targeted delivery of therapeutics to hormone responsive breast cancer cells.",

This paper details the fabrication and characterization of an integrated point-of-use soil-testing system, comprised of disposable ion-selective electrode strips and a handheld electrochemical reader. Together, the strips and reader transduce soil ion concentrations into to an alphanumeric output that can be communicated via text message to a central service provider offering immediate, customized fertilizer advisory. The solid-state ion-selective electrode (SS-ISE) strips employ a two-electrode design with screen-printable carbon nanotube ink serving as the electrical contacts for the working and reference electrodes. The working electrode comprises a plasticizer-free butyl acrylate ion-selective membrane (ISM), doped with an ion-selective ionophore and lipophilic salt. Meanwhile, the reference electrode includes a screen-printed silver-silver chloride ink and a polyvinyl-butyral membrane, which is doped with sodium chloride for stable reference potentials. As a proof of concept, potassium-selective electrodes are studied, given potassium’s essential role in plant growth and reproduction. The ISE-based system is reproducibly manufactured to yield a Nernstian response with a sub-micromolar detection limit (pK+ of 5.18 ± 0.08) and near-Nernstian sensitivity (61 mV/decade) in the presence of a 0.02 M strontium chloride extraction solution. Analysis of soil samples using the printed electrodes and reader yielded a correlation coefficient of 𝑅2 = 0.89 with respect to values measured via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).

To our knowledge, exactly one hydroxyl group of every polyacrylate chain has not been reported. The hydroxyl-terminated poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) has been successfully synthesized by degenerative iodine transfer polymerization (DITP) of the n-butyl acrylate (n-BA) using 4,4′-azobis(4-cyano-1-pentanol) (ACPO) and diiodoxylene (DIX) as initiator and chain transfer agent, respectively, and subsequently substituted reaction of the iodine-terminated PBA with β-mercaptoethanol in alkaline condition. The latter reaction was highly efficient, and the terminal iodine at the end of polymer chains were almost quantitatively transformed to a hydroxyl group. 2,2′-Azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) and ACPO were used as initiators in the DITPs of n-BA. The results demonstrated that they had a significant influence on the terminal groups of the formed polymer chains. The structure, molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution of the hydroxyl-terminated PBA have been studied by 1H, 13C NMR, and GPC results. The components of hydroxyl-terminated PBA were determined by MALDI-TOF MS spectra, and their formation is discussed. The broad molecular weight distribution of the PBA and the difference in the polymerization behaviors from typical living radical polymerization are explained based on the results of 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF MS spectra. The hydroxyl-terminated PBA has been successfully used in the preparation of PBA-based polyurethane dispersions (PUDs).

Herein, a class of tough and strong self-healing polyacrylate elastomers (denoted as HPs) was developed simply by free-radical copolymerization of n-butyl acrylate (nBA) and tert-butyl acrylate (tBA) and a subsequent hydrolysis reaction rather than direct copolymerization of nBA and acrylic acid (AA). The tiny difference in reactivity between nBA and tBA makes the structural units of the copolymer easy to control. Precise regulation of molecular composition can be realized just by varying the relative monomer content, making its mechanical properties to vary from ductile to robust. Strikingly, when HP samples are cut off within the gauge length, they can heal into coherent and smooth samples and recover at least 79% of the original strength. Hydrogen bond interactions serve as physical cross-linking points, contributing to the high mechanical performance (fracture energy of up to 73.78 MJ·m-3 and tensile strength of up to 17.80 MPa) as well as shape memory function.

The results showed that the introduction of DDM and HDDA has no significant effects on the final particle size of the fluorinated pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) latexes. XPS analysis indicated that the fluoroalkyl groups had the tendency to enrich on the surface of the film.

A series of divinylphenyl-acryloyl chloride copolymers (PDVB-co-PACl) is synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization employing tert-butyl acrylate and divinylbenzene as monomers. PDVB-co-PACl is utilized to graft on the surface of spherical aluminum nitride (AlN) to prepare functionalized AlN (AlN@PDVB-co-PACl). Polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) is then used as the matrix to prepare thermally conductive AlN@PDVB-co-PACl/PMHS composites with AlN@PDVB-co-PACl as fillers through blending and curing. The grafting of PDVB-co-PACl synchronously enhances the hydrolysis resistance of AlN and its interfacial compatibility with PMHS matrix. When the molecular weight of PDVB-co-PACl is 5100 g mol−1 and the grafting density is 0.8 wt%, the composites containing 75 wt% of AlN@PDVB-co-PACl exhibit the optimal comprehensive performance. The thermal conductivity (λ) of the composite is 1.14 W m−1 K−1, which enhances by 20% and 420% compared to the λ of simply physically blended AlN/PMHS composite and pure PMHS, respectively. Meanwhile, AlN@PDVB-co-PACl/PMHS composites display remarkable hydrothermal aging resistance by retaining 99.1% of its λ after soaking in 90 °C deionized water for 80 h, whereas the λ of the blended AlN/PMHS composites decreases sharply to 93.7%.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we present an industrially applicable strategy to enhance the heat resistance and adhesive properties of ABA triblock copolymer-based elastomers composed of styrene (St) and n-butyl acrylate (nBA) by incorporating acrylic acid (AA) at different segments. Three types of triblock copolymers, namely, poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA), poly(St)-b-poly(nBA-r-AA)-b-poly(St), and poly(St)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St), were synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Large-scale RAFT polymerization afforded industrially applicable AA-containing triblock copolymers with moderate molecular weights and predetermined comonomer compositions (St/nBA/AA = 15/83/2–24/73/3, number-average molecular weight (Mn) = 30,000–110,000, and resulting product > 200 g). The heat resistance and pressure-sensitive adhesive properties of the triblock copolymers were evaluated. Among them, poly(St-r-AA)-b-poly(nBA)-b-poly(St-r-AA), having poly(nBA) as the middle soft segment and poly(St-r-AA) as hard segments at both ends, exhibited excellent heat creep resistance and increased adhesiveness to stainless steel. The feasibility to manipulate the heat resistance and adhesive properties by incorporating AA units into hard and soft segments, in addition to the ease of operation, high block efficiency, and metal-free nature owing to the RAFT process, is highly beneficial for practical applications of these copolymers.",

The formation of well‐defined ternary graft copolymers was confirmed by both size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and 1H NMR spectroscopy The loose and worm‐like morphology of the ternary graft copolymer in a common solvent (N,N‐dimethylformamide) for both the backbone and the grafts was directly visualized via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The average height, width, and length of these solvated macromolecules were about 1.5, 17, and 45 nm, respectively. The ternary graft copolymers underwent self‐assembly in different selective solvents (dichloromethane, methanol, and water) and thus yielded unimolecular micelles (UMs) with different morphologies. The morphological transitions in response to variations in the selective solvents was investigated by AFM as well as/or transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Experimental results showed that the micellar morphology of the ternary graft copolymer changed from a pearl‐necklace to a worm‐like structure and then to a spherical structure when the selective solvent was respectively changed from CH2Cl2 to CH3OH and then to H2O. SEC characterization revealed that the compact globules formed in H2O with PCEMA/PtBA as the hydrophobic core arose due to intramolecular folding. Thus, multicompartment UMs were generated. The volume ratio of the multicompartment UMs formed in H2O was in close agreement with their molecular weight ratio.

However, making the trade‐off between appropriate viscosity and UV‐curing properties in a high‐performing polymer system remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, firstly, a series of acrylate copolymer oligomers (named as PAAR) were synthesized using methyl methacrylate (MMA), butyl acrylate (BA), and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), then methacrylic acid (MAA) was grafted utilizing the reaction between carboxyl group in MAA with epoxy group in oligomer to introduce double bonds. By adjusting the oligomer molecular weight to control the viscosity and changing the GMA ratio to obtain suitable double bonds content. As a result, the number molecular weight (Mn) of the thus‐obtained PAAR oligomers were less than 3000 Da, and the polymer dispersity indexes (PDI) were lower than 1.8. Photo‐polymerization kinetics revealed that the coating prepared using the oligomers could be fully cross‐linked by UV light triggering within 60 s, achieving a high transparency of 90% along with favorable thermal and mechanical properties. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the water resistance on the surface of the cured films and hydrophobicity were more influenced by the presence of hydroxyl groups.",

    "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c02170",
    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "The distribution of surfactants in waterborne colloidal polymer films is of significant interest for scientific understanding and defining surface properties in applications including pressure-sensitive adhesives and coatings. Because of negative effects on appearance, wetting, and adhesion, it is desirable to prevent surfactant accumulation at film surfaces. The effect of particle deformation on surfactant migration during film formation was previously investigated by Gromer et al. through simulations, but experimental investigations are lacking. Here, we study deuterium-labeled sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant in a poly(butyl acrylate) latex model system. The particle deformability was varied via cross-linking of the intraparticle polymer chains by differing extents. The cross-linker concentration varied from 0 to 35 mol % in the copolymer, leading to a transition from viscoelastic to elastic. Ion beam analysis was used to probe the dry films and provide information on the near-surface depth distribution of surfactant. Films of nondeformable particles, containing the highest concentration of cross-linker, show no surfactant accumulation at the top surface. Films from particles partially deformed by capillary action show a distinct surfactant surface layer (ca. 150 nm thick). Films of coalesced particles, containing little or no cross-linker, show a very small amount of surfactant on the surface (ca. 20 nm thick). The observed results are explained by considering the effect of cross-linking on rubber elasticity and applying the viscous particle deformation model by Gromer et al. to elastically deformed particles. We find that partially deformed particles allow surfactant transport to the surface during film formation, whereas there is far less transport when skin formation acts as a barrier. With elastic particles, the surfactant is carried in the water phase as it falls beneath the surface of packed particles. The ability to exert control over surfactant distribution in waterborne colloidal films will aid in the design of new high-performance adhesives and coatings.",

In addition to β-substituted acrylates, α-substituted acrylates (e.g., methyl methacrylate (MMA) and n-butyl methacrylate (nBMA)) were examined as comonomers. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) characterizations of the obtained copolymers revealed that each monomer component was incorporated sufficiently. The thermal stabilities of the resulting copolymers were investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), indicating that the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the copolymers can be widely varied over a relatively high-temperature range by selecting the optimal comonomer. More specifically, the Tg values of poly(MC-random-EC) (MC/EC molar ratio = 50/50), poly(MC-random-nBC) (MC/nBC molar ratio = 50/50), poly(MC-random-MCin) (MC/MCin molar ratio = 54/46), and poly(nBC-random-MCin) (nBC/MCin molar ratio = 56/44) were 173, 130, 216, and 167 °C, respectively.

Compounds found in stickies by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry were poly (butyl-acrylate), dioctyl phthalate, poly (vinyl-acetate), and poly (vinyl-acrylate). Pulp with 4% (w/w) consistency and pH = 6.2 was sampled directly from the mill once macrostickies were removed. Stickies were quantified by counting the tacky macrostructures in the liquid fraction of the pulp using a Neubauer chamber before the paper was made, and they were analyzed with rhodamine dye and a UV lamp.

Artemov, the synthesis of chromium-containing isoxazolines by the reaction of 1,3-lipolar cycloaddition was studied and an increase in cis/trans selectivity was demonstrated when introducing a tricarbonylchromium group into molecules of dipoles and dipolarophiles. Arentricarbonylchromium derivatives of six–membered heterocycles with N–C–O bonds, like their five-membered analogues, can be obtained by reaction between heterocycles free of the tricarbonylchromium group, as well as a result of condensation of chromium-containing amino alcohols with carbonyl compounds. The synthesis of bi- and polymetallic compounds in the reactions of organometallic halides with various non-transition metals has been studied. Such reactions make it possible in a one-step process to obtain compounds containing covalent bonds of metals of 12–15 groups (Mg, Zn, Cd, In, Tl, Sn, Pb, Bi) with non-transitive elements (Fe, Mo, W). Styrene chromium tricarbonyl, para-methylstyrene chromium tricarbonyl, α-methylstyrene chromium tricarbonyl, stilbene chromium tricarbonyl, allylbenzene chromium tricarbonyl, and diphenylbutadiene chromium tricarbonyl were studied as polymerization regulators by the mechanism of reversible inhibition for vinyl monomers. α-methylstyrene chromium tricarbonyl, diphenylbutadiene chromium tricarbonyl, allylbenzene chromium tricarbonyl. When they are introduced into the polymerizing mass of methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, styrene in quantities commensurate with the concentration of the initiator, they control the termination of the polymer chain at temperatures not exceeding 100 °C. At the same time, the process proceeds at a sufficiently high rate, and the control of chain growth follows the mechanism of reversible inhibition. The gas-phase decomposition of bis-ethylbenzenechromium can proceed with the formation of hard and wear-resistant chromium carbide coatings, as well as with the production of chromium films characterized by a low temperature resistance coefficient.",

The successfulness of digital printing can be measured in terms of the degree to which the properties of toner are finely controlled. In this work, we applied response surface methodology (RSM) to synthesize printing toners with appropriate physical and color properties. Based on a systematic experimental pattern proposed by RSM, styrene and butyl acrylate monomers are copolymerized through suspension polymerization to determine the individual and interactive effects of foregoing material parameters on the particle size, particle size distribution, and thermal and color properties of the resulting toner composites. Different analyses are carried out through which the optimum criterion for manufacturing well-controlled toner particles is established. Particularly, the results show that fine-tuning of toner properties depends on the careful regulation of material parameters, which we have learned from interactive effect identification.",

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the structure of KH590‐GM and GM functionalized nanosilica. Thermogravimetry analysis indicated that the grafting rate of GM functionalized nanosilica reached 13.4%, and the antioxidant had good thermal stability. Scanning electron microscope and mechanical properties measurement showed GM functionalized nanosilica was dispersed uniformly in NR vulcanizates, and helpful for the increase of the tensile strength and tensile stress of NR vulcanizates. Based on the study of the antioxidative behavior and extraction resistance of the NR vulcanizates, it was found that in contrast to NR vulcanizates with GM, the ageing coefficient and oxidation induction time of that with GM functionalized nanosilica increased to 0.66 and 39 min from 0.58 and 30 min, respectively.

The relative strength of the H-bonding and Coulombic interaction can be easily tuned by the hydrolysis degree (DH) of the PtBA block and the amount of doped salt.

To accomplish this, a new class of ABC type triblock copolymer (PMTAC-b-PBA-b-PIBA) based on 2-(methcryloyloxy) ethyl ammonium chloride (MTAC), n-butyl acrylate (BA) and isobornyl acrylate (IBA) was synthesized via polymerization induced self-assembly (PISA) technique in a surfactant-free miniemulsion process.

    "abstract": "Binary and ternary copolymers of acrylonitrile (AN), tert-butyl acrylate (TBA), and n-butyl acrylate (BA) are synthesized through conventional radical polymerization in DMSO in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The thermal behavior of binary and ternary copolymers is studied under argon atmosphere and in air. It is demonstrated that the copolymers of AN contain 1–10 mol.% of TBA split isobutylene upon heating above 160 °C, resulting in the formation of the units of acrylic acid in the chain. The carboxylic groups formed in situ are responsible for the ionic mechanism of cyclization, which starts at lower temperatures compared with pure polyacrylonitrile (PAN) or AN copolymer with BA. The activation energy of cyclization through ionic and radical mechanisms depends on copolymer composition. For the ionic mechanism, the activation energy lies in the range ca. 100–130 kJ/mole, while for the radical mechanism, it lies in the range ca. 150–190 kJ/mole. The increase in the TBA molar part in the copolymer is followed by faster consumption of nitrile groups and the evolution of a ladder structure in both binary and ternary copolymers. Thus, the incorporation of a certain amount of TBA in PAN or its copolymer with BA allows tuning the temperature range of cyclization. This feature seems attractive for applications in the production of melt-spun PAN by choosing the appropriate copolymer composition and heating mode.",

Favorable reaction conditions (acrylic acid: n-butanol molar ratio 1:2, cyclohexane as a solvent, biocatalyst 0.150 g per 1 mmol of acrylic acid, temperature 25 °C) allowed the achievement of a 99% yield of n-butyl acrylate in 24 h. Screening of various ionic liquids showed that the most promising result was obtained if N-(6-deoxy-1-O-methoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([N(CH3)3GlcOCH3][N(Tf)2]) was selected in order to modify the outer surface of MWCNTs. The final SILP biocatalyst–CNTs-[N(CH3)3GlcOCH3][N(Tf)2]-CALB contained 1.8 wt.% of IL and 4.2 wt.% of CALB. Application of the SILP biocatalyst led to the enhanced activity of CALB in comparison with the biocatalyst prepared via physical adsorption of CALB onto MWCNTs (CNTs-CALB), as well as with commercially available Novozyme 435. Thus, the crucial role of IL in the stabilization of biocatalysts was clearly demonstrated.

An electrochemical biosensor for rapid detection of E2 in water samples was successfully developed. The biosensor was based on split DNA aptamers attached onto poly (methacrylic acid-co-n butyl acrylate-succinimide) microspheres deposited on polypyrrole nanowires coated electrode (PPY/PMAA-NBA). The sandwich paired of split DNA aptamers used were truncated from 75 mer parent aptamers. These two strands of 12-mer and 14-mer split DNA aptamers were then immobilized on the PMAA-NBA microspheres. In the presence of E2, the split DNA aptamers formed an apt12-E2-apt14 complex, where the binding reaction on the electrode surface led to the detection of E2 by differential pulse voltammetry using ferrocyanide as a redox indicator. Under optimum conditions, the aptasensor detected E2 concentrations in the range of 1 × 10−4 M to 1 × 10−12 M (R2 = 0.9772) with a detection limit of 4.8 × 10−13 M.

However, the impact of surfactants on the electrical and mechanical properties of such nanocomposite films remains to be explored. We have systematically studied the impact of two anionic surfactants [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS)] on intrinsic properties of the nanocomposite films comprising reduced graphene oxide in a matrix of poly(styrene-stat-n-butyl acrylate). Using these ambient temperature film-forming systems, we fabricated films with different concentrations of the surfactants (1-7 wt %, relative to the organic phase). Significant differences in film properties were observed both as a function of amount and type of surfactant. Thermally reduced films exhibited concentration-dependent increases in surface roughness, electrical conductivity, and mechanical properties with increasing SDS content. When compared with SDBS, SDS films exhibited an order of magnitude higher electrical conductivity values at every concentration (highest value of ∼4.4 S m-1 for 7 wt % SDS) and superior mechanical properties at higher surfactant concentrations. The present results illustrate how the simple inclusion of a benzene ring in the SDS structure (as in SDBS) can cause a significant change in the electrical and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite.

The film was synthesized by copolymerizing butyl acrylate (BA), 2‐ethylhexyl acrylate (2‐EHA), 2‐hydroxyethyl acrylate (2‐HEA), and acrylic acid (AA), with the ratio of AA to 2‐HEA adjusted to optimize adhesion and material properties. AA increased the polarity of the polymer, enhancing adhesion through hydrogen bonding, while 2‐HEA contributed to both adhesion and crosslinking. As the AA content increased, the adhesive strength improved, ranging from 504.73 N/m to a maximum of 812.6 N/m. After adding 20 wt% Ni powder, the adhesive strength ranged from 331.89 N/m to a maximum of 700.79 N/m. The rate of peel strength reduction caused by Ni addition decreased as the AA content increased. The vertical and horizontal resistances of the resulting adhesive film were measured to be 0.43 mΩ and 0.11 Ω, respectively, indicating low electrical resistance. The electromagnetic shielding performance was measured according to ASTM D4935 using a vector network analyzer, over a frequency range of 9 kHz–8.5 GHz, and exhibited an average shielding effectiveness of approximately 63.7 dB.

The studies conducted are the same as those mentioned for the effect of comonomer composition in feed.

The mechanical properties of the films improved as the percentage of IPMBI increased, while the boundary characteristics to moisture and oxygen improved when compared to the white film (0% of IPMBI).

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The use of Raman spectroscopy for reaction monitoring has been successfully applied over the past few decades. One complication in such usage is the applicability for quantitative reaction studies. This analytical problem is intrinsic to any reaction system, and is part of the larger transinformation necessary to bridge qualitative Raman spectroscopic information through multivariate calibration approaches. Another compounding issue is the presence of unknown component spectra that are encountered when investigating novel reactions, which is often fraught with either a lack of understanding of reaction stoichiometries/mechanisms, or inability to isolate reaction intermediates or products for obtaining their Raman spectra. To overcome these analytical challenges, three numerical approaches are tested using the model styrene–butyl acrylate co-polymerization reaction. They are partial least squares regression (PLSR), a novel minimisation of mixture spectrum residuals (MMSR) algorithm, and the first ever attempt at combining band-target entropy minimisation curve resolution with multilinear regression (BTEM-MLR). Multivariate calibrations are performed using inline Raman spectra from co-polymerization monitored with offline NMR to estimate the concentration of monomers without the need for additional information on reaction intermediates or products. All three multivariate calibration approaches produce comparable success. The specific calibration dataset utilized and relative Raman molar intensities of chemical species directly impact the quality of calibration. Furthermore, both MMSR and BTEM yield additional spectral reconstruction of the unknown co-polymer Raman spectrum.",

Results showed that long-chain fatty acids were grafted to NCC through esterification initiated at a low temperature. When the dosage of L-MNCC, P-MNCC, and S-MNCC was 0.05%, the styrene-acrylic emulsion had 92.5%, 94.2%, and 96.3% conversion rates, respectively, and exhibited good dilution, pH, Ca2+, and centrifugal stability. The particle size of styrene-acrylic emulsion was approximately 460 nm, and the absolute value of the Zeta potential increased with the MNCC concentration. According to the images of optical microscopy and the transmission electron microscope, the MNCC was adsorbed onto the surface of styrene-acrylic emulsion droplets. The synergistic effect from the electrostatic repulsion of MNCC, the hydrophile lipophilicity of MNCC, and the spatial hindrance of the MNCC adsorption layer provided good stability for the styrene-acrylic emulsion. Therefore, MNCC could replace traditional surfactants in stabilizing emulsion.",

Here, we present a new water rewritable PC film as large as the A4 size (210 × 300 mm2) with a high-quality structure color. The material is prepared by thermal assisted self-assembly on the air-liquid interface. To fix such a large-area self-assembled PC film, we partially deform and coalesce the self-assembled nanoparticles, which have low glass transition temperature. This process causes the film to be transparent and structural colorless but still keeps the inner 3D-ordered structure. Then, utilizing the hydrophilic nature of the assembled block, the film can be switched to a structural color state by touching water. Diverse brilliant structural colors appear with different assembled particle (poly(butyl methacrylate- co-methylmethacrylate- co-butyl acrylate- co-diacetone acrylamide) named as PBMBD) sizes.

A robust nanogenerator based on poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBA)–grafted polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) copolymers via dielectric constant control through an atom-transfer radical polymerization technique, which can markedly increase the output power, is demonstrated. The copolymer is mainly composed of α phases with enhanced dipole moments due to the π-bonding and polar characteristics of the ester functional groups in the PtBA, resulting in the increase of dielectric constant values by approximately twice, supported by Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements. This increase in the dielectric constant significantly increased the density of the charges that can be accumulated on the copolymer during physical contact. The nanogenerator generates output signals of 105 V and 25 μA/cm2, a 20-fold enhancement in output power, compared to pristine PVDF–based nanogenerator after tuning the surface potential using a poling method. The markedly enhanced output performance is quite stable and reliable in harsh mechanical environments due to the high flexibility of the films.

In copolymer analysis in MS, an increase in the number of monomer unit species and/or the polymer molecular weight results in complex mass spectra and a method to solve this problem is required.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this study, electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS) was employed to analyze styrene/methyl methacrylate/n-butyl acrylate (St/MMA/nBA) terpolymers via Kendrick mass defect (KMD) analysis. An expanded Fourier-transform (FT)-based noise-reduction method for the copolymer was developed to improve a decrease in the signal/noise ratio observed in the higher m/z region.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLow-mass terpolymers (0.7 kDa) were identified by comparing the observed and theoretical results using a 2D KMD plot. For the 1.5 kDa terpolymer, the signal overlap, of which KMD value was not matched with the theoretical one, was interpreted by the shift from the theoretical value in the KMD plot. For the 3.0 kDa terpolymers, the compositional candidates were determined by the prediction based on the compositional information of low-mass terpolymers previously analyzed. The 4.5 kDa terpolymer was interpreted after the expanded noise filtering.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe terpolymers, of which molecular weight is up to 4.5 kDa, were successfully characterized at a molecular level.

While there has been considerable effort directed towards developing different nanozymes, there has been limited progress in fabricating composite materials based on such nanozymes. One of the biggest gaps in the field is the control, tuneability, and on-demand catalytic response. Herein, a nanocomposite nanozymatic film that enables precise tuning of catalytic activity through stretching is demonstrated. In a systematic study, we developed poly(styrene-stat-n-butyl acrylate)/iron oxide-embedded porous silica nanoparticle (FeSiNP) nanocomposite films with controlled, highly tuneable, and on-demand activatable peroxidase-like activity. The polymer/FeSiNP nanocomposite was designed to undergo film formation at ambient temperature yielding a highly flexible and stretchable film, responsible for enabling precise control over the peroxidase-like activity. The fabricated nanocomposite films exhibited a prolonged FeSiNP dose-dependent catalytic response. Interestingly, the optimised composite films with 10 wt% FeSiNP exhibited a drastic change in the enzymatic activity upon stretching, which provides the nanocomposite films with an on-demand performance activation characteristic. This is the first report showing control over the nanozyme activity using a nanocomposite film, which is expected to pave the way for further research in the field leading to the development of system-embedded activatable sensors for diagnostic, food spoilage, and environmental applications.",

The XPS results indicated that the surface atom percentage of F element of film increased with the escalation of the length of fluorocarbon lateral chain, which results in the water contact angle and surface roughness increment of the PSA films.

    "abstract": "Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) pose a serious threat to human health and the environment. Unfortunately, many processes from fine chemistry involve VOCs as reagents, solvents, products or by-products. International standards and market requirements keep asking for lower VOC content in commercial goods, with the final aim of VOC-free products. Accomplishing such a task is a challenge because VOCs, due to their high vapour pressure, are hard to remove with traditional industrial methods, such as vacuum stripping or absorption. For this reason, it is important to know and understand how VOCs evolve throughout a chemical reaction. In this field, adhesives, which are usually developed exploiting polymerizations, represent an interesting subject, due to the complexity of their industrial synthesis: VOCs appear as reagents (monomers), conversion enhancers (post-polymerization), and by-products (hydrolysis and small chains). In this work, a study on the evolution and content of VOCs of an industrial recipe involving emulsion polymerizations is carried out. The industrial recipe is characterized by high solids content (about 70% w/w) and is mainly composed of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (up to 50% w/w), anionic and nonionic surfactants. The evolution of the main VOCs found under different working conditions is discussed.

Copolymerization of Methyl meth acrylate (MMA) with butyl acrylate has been carried out for modifying the properties of the polymer. Dynamic swelling kinetics were conducted at room temperatures to investigate the synthesized binder's swelling properties for paint industries. The experimental swelling curves were analyzed using three different models: Peleg's model, the first-order absorption kinetic model, and the exponential association equation model. All of these models demonstrated excellent agreement with the experimental data, as indicated by high R-Square values and low values for Chi Square, Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Comparing the determination coefficients for these models, it was concluded that the Peleg model provides a better representation of the swelling characteristics across various concentrations of the crosslinker in the polymer.

Herein, a facile access to harvest monodispersed microspheres based on the emulsion polymerization mechanism is demonstrated, where anionic and nonionic surfactants are employed to achieve the electrostatic and steric dual‐stabilization balance in a synergistic manner. Monodispersed poly(styrene‐butyl acrylate‐methacrylic acid) colloidal latex with 55 wt% HSC is achieved, which shows an enhanced self‐assembly efficiency of 280% compared with the low solid content (10 wt%) latex. In addition, Ag‐coated colloidal photonic crystal (Ag@CPC) coating with near‐zero refractive index is achieved, presenting the characteristics of metamaterials. And an 11‐fold photoluminescence emission enhancement of CdSe@ZnS quantum dots is realized by the Ag@CPC metamaterial coating. Taking advantage of high assembly efficiency, easily large‐scale film‐forming of the 55 wt% HSC microspheres latex, robust Ag@CPC metamaterial coatings could be easily produced for passive cooling.

Three types of self-assembled nanostructures, such as spheres, random cylinders, and curved lamella, were controlled in phenol novolac-cured epoxy blends with a wide range of BCP content. Three types of nanostructures were observed using two-dimensional and three-dimensional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The 3D-TEM, dynamic viscoelastic analyses, and theoretical model on the elastic modulus clarified that the spheres and the random cylinders, consisted of epoxy-immiscible PnBA phases, were discontinuously dispersed in the epoxy matrix.

The highest GIC was obtained from the random cylindrical nanostructured blends in the three types of nanostructures with the same PnBA content.

    "abstract": "Dust palliatives are used to reduce fugitive dust in areas susceptible to erosion by wind and rain. In 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) temporarily approved the use of polymer-based dust palliatives during the construction and operation of a solar energy facility and, in 2019, on a mining access road in Clark County, Nevada. The areas treated with palliative are habitat to the desert tortoise. The desert tortoise consumes water opportunistically from puddles, saturated soils, or by the collection of precipitation on their carapaces. Since little is known about the toxicity of polymeric substances to the desert tortoise, the BLM is concerned with the exposure of the desert tortoise to palliative in stormwater runoff. The BLM collaborated with the US Geological Survey (USGS) to evaluate the transport of butyl acrylate vinyl acetate (BA-VA), the copolymer ingredient in the dust palliatives applied in the study, away from areas of application. BA-VA concentrations were measured in soils treated with palliative up to 90 days post-treatment, after which the copolymer became undetectable (< 0.55 mg/g). BA-VA concentrations in all stormwater samples within and outside treated areas were consistently below detection (< 0.20 mg/mL). Although stormwater and treated soils eroded from the solar facility application area were found to have BA-VA concentrations below detection (< 0.55 mg/g), it is likely that some BA-VA (parent or degradation product) was transported with suspended material. It is also likely that the amount of BA-VA transported away from areas of application was a small fraction of that applied.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control the interparticle distance in self-assembled arrays of nanoparticles plays an important role in a large number of applications, which require tunable electronic and photonic properties. Importantly, practical applications in real devices rely on arrays satisfying more stringent requirements of lateral homogeneity controlled over a large scale. Herein, the interparticle distance in ordered nanoparticle assemblies was controlled by varying the nanoparticle effective size via the molecular chemical nature and chain length of the ligand. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were functionalized by three types of ligands, namely (i) a mixture of oleic acid/oleylamine (OA/OAm), (ii) poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) and (iii) polystyrene (PS), while two different molar masses of PBA and PS were used. The polymeric ligands with narrow dispersity and bearing phosphonic chain-end groups were prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization. Functionalization of the IONPs with polymeric ligands was achieved using a ligand exchange method. Both the hydrodynamic diameter and size distribution of the nanoparticles in colloidal solution were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The mean interparticle distances in Langmuir-Schaefer monolayers prepared on solid substrates were assessed by means of the pair correlation function calculated from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. Furthermore, the lateral ordering, homogeneity, and interparticle distances averaged over a mesoscopic scale of the ordered monolayers were studied by the grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) technique. We demonstrate that the (nanoparticle) centre-to-centre distance in the ordered assemblies constituted by the IONPs with the core diameter of about 6 nm can be varied from 7.6 to about 12 nm with the resulting interparticle gap change by a factor of about 4.",

    "abstract": "Microwave heating provides an efficient method to rapidly heat materials through interaction of microwaves with the media. Here we demonstrate the rapid synthesis of mesopores cobalt oxide films through the heating of the silicon substrate by microwaves. A non-sol gel approach based on cobalt nitrate-citric acid complex cooperative assembly with poly[methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)methacrylate]-block-poly(butyl acrylate) (PMPEGMA-b-PBA) block copolymer was used to fabricate the cobalt oxide through a cobalt carbonate intermediate. The time required to convert cobalt carbonate to cobalt oxide with the full removal of PMPEGMA-b-PBA template can be decreased by two orders of magnitude with microwaves in comparison to standard heating in a furnace at 350 ºC. At the highest microwave power examined (1500 W), this can be accomplished within 2 s, while > 5 min is required at 350 ºC in a furnace. At microwave power < 400 W, there is insufficient energy to induce the transition from carbonate to oxide, but even at only 420 W the oxide can be formed within 26 s. The rapid heating by the microwaves tends to increase the crystallinity and mean crystal size of the cobalt oxide within the mesoporous films. Despite the growth of larger average crystals, the pore size and porosity tends to be larger when the film is processed using microwaves, with higher microwave power leading to larger average crystals and average pore size. These results suggest that rapid processing to crystallize frameworks in mesoporous materials may allow for highly crystalline frameworks without loss of the ordered mesostructure.",

However, individual antigen molecules are low-immunogenic, and therefore require conjugation with a compound possessing stronger adjuvant properties [3, 10]. Salts of aluminum, aqueous emulsions of squalene, viruses, virus-like nanoparticles, cationic liposomes, and others are used as adjuvants. A strong immune response in mice has been achieved with complete Freund’s adjuvant, which includes lanolin, vaseline oil and killed mycobacterium tuberculosis [7]. However, it has got negative because of granulomas formation at the injection sites [6] and not suitable for the preparation of vaccines. The aluminum oxide hydrate and aluminum phosphate [2] only are currently authorized for use in most countries as adjuvants. Despite the fact that aluminum compounds are considered as safe, the occurrence of abscesses, eosinophils, granules and allergic manifestations at their application has been observed [1]. Therefore, the problem of expanding the assortment of such drugs continues to be topical and important. The purpose of this study is to compare immunological effect of the created polymers using antigen – BSA model and to investigate their effect on the activity of enzymes of antioxidant defense, as well as ALT and AST.

Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), butyl acrylate (BA), acrylic acid (AA), and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TGMDMA) have been used to obtain microsized PHG. Polymerization has been carried out in the flat bottom dilatometers or reactors at stirring for six hours at 70 ± 0.2 °C pre-filled by argon. The kinetic of the reaction has been studied using dilatometric and gravimetric techniques. Polymer has been separated and washed to remove not reacted monomers. As a result of the polymerization a cross-linked PHG has been received (Fig. 1). The content of the carboxyl groups has been determined by reverse acid-base titration followed by centrifugation and the selection of the liquid phase for analysis, the content of epoxy groups by the reverse titration of the residues of chloric acid in 0.1 N NaOH.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Porous polymer membranes with highly interconnected open-cellular structure and high toughness are crucial for various application fields. Polymerized high internal phase emulsions (polyHIPEs), which usually exist as monoliths, possess the advantages of high porosity and good connectivity. However, it is difficult to prepare membranes due to brittleness and easy pulverization. Copolymerizing acrylate soft monomers can effectively improve the toughness of polyHIPEs, but it is easy to cause emulsion instability and pore collapse. In this paper, stable HIPEs with a high content of butyl acrylate (41.7 mol% to 75 mol% based on monomers) can be obtained by using a composite emulsifier (30 wt.% based on monomers) consisting of Span80/DDBSS (9/2 in molar ratio) and adding 0.12 mol·L−1 CaCl2 according to aqueous phase concentration. On this basis, polyHIPE membranes with high open-cellular extent and high toughness are firstly prepared via reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The addition of the RAFT agent significantly improves the mechanical properties of polyHIPE membranes without affecting open-cellular structure. The toughness of polyHIPE membranes prepared by RAFT polymerization is significantly enhanced compared with conventional free radical polymerization. When the molar ratio of butyl acrylate/styrene/divinylbenzene is 7/4/1, the polyHIPE membrane prepared by RAFT polymerization presents plastic deformation during the tensile test. The toughness modulus reaches 93.04 ± 12.28 kJ·m−3 while the open-cellular extent reaches 92.35%, and it also has excellent thermal stability.",

This work describes the treatment of the different surfaces, establishes the optimal curing conditions from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of these novel adhesive systems, and evaluates the results of the single‐lap shear test for metal joints. Thus, by dynamic DSC measurements of the mixtures, a low curing temperature of 90 °C is defined when DEA is used as a curative; while systems based on DICY and 2‐CA require temperatures of 150 °C and 160 °C, respectively. In addition, the curing process of this controlled acrylic copolymer with DICY exhibits a singular behavior, possibly due to the curing reaction mechanism, where multiple epoxy‐amine ring‐opening polyaddition reactions take place between DICY's active hydrogens and epoxy groups of poly(GMA‐co‐BA). This latter curing system shows the highest adhesion features with lap‐shear strength at room temperature of 15.5 MPa, using copper as metallic substrate; however, the best results are obtained using 2‐CA as curing agent with aluminum and iron.",

    "abstract": "It has been observed that acrylate monomers are very difficult to polymerize with the low cost nitroxide catalyst 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO). Therefore, costly acyclic nitroxides such as N-tert-butyl-N-(1-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethyl)-N-oxyl, (SG1), 2,2,5-Trimethyl-4-phenyl-3-azahexane-3-nitroxide (TIPNO) and TIPNO derivatives have to be used for the polymerization of the acrylic acid derivatives. There are very few reports on the use of TEMPO-derivatives toward the polymerization of n-butyl acrylate. Generally different reducing agents viz. glucose, ascorbic acid, hydroxyacetone etc. have been used to destroy excess TEMPO during the polymerization reaction. The acrylate polymerizations fail in the presence of TEMPO due to the strong C–O bond formed between the acrylate chain end and nitroxide. To the best of our knowledge, no literature report is available on the use of TEMPO without reducing agent or high temperature initiators, toward the polymerization of n-butyl acrylate. The present study has been carried out with a view to re-examine the application of low cost nitroxide TEMPO, so that it can be utilized towards the polymerization of acrylate monomers (e.g. n-butyl acrylate). We have been able to polymerize n-butyl acrylate using the nitroxide TEMPO as initiator (via a macroinitiator). In this synthesis, a polystyrene macroinitiator was synthesized in the first step from TEMPO, after this TEMPO end-capped styrene macroinitiator (PSt-TEMPO) is used to polymerize n-butyl acrylate monomer. The amount of macroinitiator taken was varied from 0.05% to 50% by weight of n-butyl acrylate monomer. The polymerization was carried out at 120°C by bulk polymerization method. The experimental findings showed a gradual increase in molecular weight of the polymer formed and decrease in the polydispersity index (PDI) with increase in amount of PSt-TEMPO macroinitiator taken. In all experiments conversion was more than 80%. These results indicate that the polymerization takes place through controlled polymerization process. Effect of different solvents on polymerization has also been investigated. In the following experiments TEMPO capped styrene has been used as macroinitiator leading to the successful synthesis of poly n-Butyl acrylate. It has been found that styrene macroinitiator is highly efficient for the nitroxide mediated polymerization, even in very small concentration for the synthesis of poly n-butyl acrylate. High concentration of macroinitiator results in the formation of block copolymers of polystyrene and poly (n-butyl acrylate) viz. polystyrene-block-poly-(n-butyl acrylate). The use of TEMPO toward controlled polymerization is of much importance, because it is the nitroxide commercially available at the lowest cost.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can colonize essentially any surface and form antibiotic resistant biofilms, which are multicellular structures embedded in an extracellular matrix secreted by the attached cells. To develop better biofilm control technologies, we recently demonstrated that mature biofilms can be effectively removed through on-demand shape recovery of a shape memory polymer (SMP) composed of tert-butyl acrylate (tBA). It was further demonstrated that such a dynamic substratum can sensitize the detached biofilm cells to antibiotics. However, this SMP can undergo shape change only once, limiting its application in long-term biofilm control. This motivated the present study, which aimed to prove the concept that biofilm can be effectively removed by repeated on-demand shape recovery. Reversible shape memory polymers (rSMPs) containing poly(ε-caprolactone) diisocyanatoethyl dimethacrylate (PCLDIMA) of varying molecular masses and butyl acrylate (BA) as a linker were synthesized by using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as a thermal initiator. By comparison of several combinations of PCLDIMA of different molecular masses, a 2:1 weight ratio mixture of 2000 and 15000 g/mol PCLDIMA was the most promising because it had a shape transition (at 36.7 °C) close to body temperature. The synthesized rSMP demonstrated good reversible shape recovery and up to 94.3 ± 1.0% removal of 48 h Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm cells after three consecutive shape recovery cycles. Additionally, the detached biofilm cells were found to be 5.0 ± 1.2 times more susceptible to 50 μg/mL tobramycin than the static control.",

The structures of the monomers and copolymers were validated by infrared (IR) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. The inhibitory activities of the copolymers on algae, bacteria, and barnacle larvae were measured, and the antifouling potencies against marine macrofouling organisms were investigated. The results showed that the grafted resin had significant inhibitory effects on the growth of three marine algae (Isochrysis galbana, Nannochloropsisoculata, and Chlorella pyrenoidosa), and three bacteria (Vibrio coralliilyticus, Staphylococcus aureus,and Vibrio parahaemolyticus). The target copolymers also showed excellent inhibition of the survival of barnacle larvae. Additionally, the release rate of the antifoulant and the results of the marine field tests indicated that the grafted copolymers had outstanding antifouling potency against the attachment of marine macrofouling organisms.",

A transparent counter electrode (CE) was prepared using tellurium-doped, mesoporous carbon (TeMC) materials, and was directly applied to bifacial, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). To improve the performance of the bifacial DSSC device, CEs should have outstanding electrocatalytic activity, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical stability, as well as high transparency. In this study, to make transparent electrodes with outstanding electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity, various TeMC materials with different carbonization temperatures were prepared by simple pyrolysis of the polyacrylonitrile-block-poly (n-butyl acrylate) (PAN-b-PBA) block copolymer in the presence of the tellurium metalloid. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared TeMC materials were evaluated through a dummy cell test, and the material with the best catalytic ability was selected and optimized for application in bifacial DSSC devices by controlling the film thickness of the CE. As a result, the bifacial DSSC devices with the TeMC CE exhibited high power conversion efficiencies (PCE), i.e., 9.43% and 8.06% under front and rear side irradiation, respectively, which are the highest values reported for bifacial DSSCs to date.

The rest of the comonomers of the formulation (methyl methacrylate, MMA, and n-butyl acrylate, BA) are partially incorporated in the initial miniemulsion or fed to the reactor as a preemulsion. In the fourth strategy, a conventional seeded semibatch emulsion polymerization is carried out using cyclodextrin in the seed and feeding the POA/MMA/BA preemulsion to the reactor. Each process strategy led to a distinct particle morphology and hence a particular film morphology. We found that the strategy that produced core–shell particles with the core composed by pure polyPOA yielded the films that showed the best corrosion protection as measured in salt-spray test (1200 h standing without damage).",

    "abstract": "Herein, we report a design strategy for developing mechanically enhanced and dynamic polymer networks by incorporating a polymer with multivalent brush architecture. Different ratios of two types of imidazole functionalized polymers, specifically poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) and poly(poly(n-butyl acrylate)) (PPnBA) were blended with Zn(II) ions, thereby forming a series of elastomers with consistent composition but varying network topologies. As the weight fraction of PPnBA increased, the melting temperature, plateau modulus, and relaxation time of the melt increased because of the increase in the crosslinking density and coordination efficiency. Remarkably, however, the activation energy of the flow, Ea, decreased with increasing amounts of PPnBA despite the observed increases in mechanical properties. This unique behavior is attributed to the multivalent nature of the brush polymer, which allows the PPnBA to generate a higher crosslinking density than networks of linear PnBA, even though the brush polymers contain a lower weight fraction of the imidazole crosslinks. This method of lowering Ea, while improving the mechanical properties of the elastomers has great potential in the development of various soft materials such as self-healing or 3D-printable elastomeric structures.",

Cohesive failure occurred for lower crosslinker content and rate, whereas interfacial failure with sawtooth‐type stringiness without a frame was observed for higher crosslinker content and rate. Front frame‐type stringiness was formed at the boundary of cohesive and interfacial failures. To clarify the formation mechanism, observation was conducted from the start of peel test until the equilibrium state. The sawtooth‐type stringiness with branches first formed at the tip. The adjoining branches were connected and the 2D frame was formed only on the adherend surface. The formed 2D frame developed toward the 3D walls and the front frame‐type was then completed. This is caused by the surface tension that acts to restrain the increase in the surface area. However, the surface area of the front frame‐type morphology was larger than the no frame‐type. The larger absorption of peeling stress by the formation of this morphology is expected to contribute to peel strength improvement.",

In our study, we functionalized montmorillonite clay nanofillers (CloisiteNa+) to fabricate recycled PET‐clay nanocomposites. The nanofillers underwent a three‐step functionalization process, involving the treatment with (3‐Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), the grafting of initiating coatings (multifunctional peroxide initiator, [MPI]) onto clay/APTES, and the subsequent fabrication of grafted brushes using poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) or poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA). The functionalization process and the properties of the modified clay were successfully confirmed through Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The fabrication of nanocomposites, incorporating both clay and functionalized clay, influenced the thermal behavior of the composites, whereas the nanofillers had no discernible impact on the flow temperature. The PET and nanocomposites exhibited liquid viscoelastic behavior, with the exception of PET with clay, which displayed shear‐thinning and “rubber‐like” behavior. Rheological curves and x‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated improved dispersion and compatibility for clay/APTES and clay functionalized with PBA‐grafted brushes within the PET matrix. In some instances, the utilization of functionalized clay resulted in enhanced compatibility and customized properties in PET‐organoclay nanocomposites compared with conventional fillers.

We compared the physicochemical properties (water-vapor permeability, peel force, peel force-time curve) between one brand-name product and eight generic products. Regarding the measurement of water-vapor permeability, the formulations using methacrylic acid n-butyl acrylate copolymer (MBA) adhesives showed higher water-vapor permeability than those using styrene isopropyl styrene block copolymer (SIS) adhesives. In the case of the formulation using SIS adhesive, the central part of the formulation had higher water-vapor permeability than both ends. In the 90-degree peel test using the methods of adhesion testing, significant differences were observed between the products, especially as the various application times (5 min, 30 min, 9 h and 24 h) increased. This may be because the longer the time of attachment to the adherend, the more the adhesive force with the adherend increased due to the \"anchoring effect\" of the adhesive. The measurement of the peel force-time curve showed different curves among the products, especially in the peel force curve of Teikoku after 24 h, which showed two characteristic peak curves. Furthermore, when the peel forces at 25°C and 40°C were compared, Mohrus and Toko showed significantly higher values at 40°C compared to 25°C.

The most important factor affecting conductivity sensors performance especially contacting (resistance) types is fouling. To investigate the consequences of fouling, four monomers with different tendencies for fouling were selected: methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, styrene, and butadiene. Two types of conductivity sensors were also selected to continuously measure conductivity: a two‐electrode sensor and an inductive sensor, and the performance of these sensors were evaluated based on some criteria such as conductivity behavior, amount of fluctuation, change in cell constant, repeatability, and status of the minimum of conductivity. The results obtained from the contacting sensor showed that fouling significantly decreased the performance of this sensor in different ways even in reaction mixtures having moderate fouling rates. However, the inductive conductivity sensor provided the possibility of reliably measuring conductivity during very high‐fouling and highly unstable emulsion polymerizations with very good repeatability.

    "abstract": "\nSuccessfully used in bone surgery for more than 65 years, self-hardening organic cements (CCOs), in particular acrylic cements, are today, the most advanced complementary biomaterials used in articular endoprosthesis. One of the strategies for obtaining of performing anchorage of artificial implants is to develop new acrylic cements with improved physical, chemical and biomechanical characteristics. The aim of this paper was to identify the compositional and morpho-structural changes of acrylic cements induced by the composition of the liquid phase of the material. Such changes influence the potential to generate the physical bonds responsible for fixation and stabilization of endoprosthesis. The samples studied had different compositions due to the mixture of acrylic monomers, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl acrylate (BuA) in the liquid component of cement. The MMA / BuA ratio varied between 1/0 v / v and 1/4 v / v. Changes in the composition and morphology of cement samples have been highlighted by ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis), EDX (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy), IR spectroscopy and SEM images. The obtained data show that minor changes in cement composition can significantly influence morpho-structural characteristics such as pore size and their distribution in the mass of fixing material.\n",

    "abstract": "Ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) utilizing Grubbs’ third-generation catalyst ((H 2 IMes)(Cl) 2 (pyr) 2 RuCHPh) shows characteristics of living polymerizations, including molecular weights increasing with monomer conversion and the ability to make (multi)block copolymers. However, irreversible termination reactions still occur due to catalyst decomposition, leading to terminated chains, especially in the context of sterically demanding monomers such as macromonomers (MM). In this work, we performed identical ROMP reactions on three different MMs in six solvents commonly used in ROMP with varying levels of purity. The solvents included ethyl acetate (EtOAc), dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ), chloroform (CHCl 3 ), toluene , tetrahydrofuran (THF), and N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF). All polymerizations were conducted under air targeting a bottlebrush polymer backbone degree of polymerization ( N bb ) of 100. All three MMs included a norbornene on the α chain end and had molecular weights ( M n ) of ~4 kg/mol. They included one polystyrene MM with a bromine on the ω chain end and two poly( n -butyl acrylate) MMs with either a bromine or a trithiocarbonate group on the ω chain end. Solvent choice, and in some cases level of purity, led to significant differences in the propagation rate in these ROMP grafting-through reactions. Of the solvents tested , propagation rates in EtOAc and CH 2 Cl 2 were approximately 4-fold and 2-fold faster, respectively, than CHCl 3 , toluene, and THF for all MMs. Propagation was much slower in DMF for the polystyrene MM than all the other solvents, and on par with the slower solvents for the two poly( n -butyl acrylate) MMs tested. The purity of the solvent in some cases had a profound effect on the propagation rate: In the case of EtOAc, purification led to a 2-fold decrease in propagation rate; in contrast, purification of THF was required to observe full decomposition, the main polymer termination route in ROMP, we uncovered dramatic solvent effects, where the catalyst decomposed over ten times faster in THF and DMF than in toluene. Finally, studies targeting N bb = 500 or 1000 revealed that toluene, EtOAc, and CH 2 Cl 2 demonstrated the highest degree of “livingness” in ROMP . These results will enable the synthesis of complex polymer architectures using ROMP with a high degree of living character.",

A beneficial effect was noted with regard to the electrical properties when adding nanoplatelets to the filler system. The cause could be a synergistic effect due to the difference in particle shape of the two fillers. Lower percolation thresholds were obtained with the conventional screw due to less breakage of the graphite nanoplatelets compared to the barrier screw. No significant changes of the electrical properties were observed when changing the temperature profiles or the screw speeds.

In this study, phase separation of a ternary mixture composed of a polybutadiene urethane diacrylate (PBUDA), a cycloaliphatic diepoxyde (CE), and hexanediol dimethacrylate (HDDMA) was investigated. Using systematic variations of the initial composition of the mixture, a miscibility phase diagram of the ternary mixture was established. Based on this diagram, a reactive copolymer (poly(butyl acrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PBGMA)) was introduced in a reference hybrid system to manipulate the crosslinking network, polymer morphology, and properties (e.g., roughness, gloss, strain at break, and glass transition temperature Tg). When cured as a coating, the ternary hybrid system showed a depthwise gradient of epoxy conversion, and thereby developed a mostly cured skin above a viscous sublayer of uncured monomer. This skin can develop compressive stress due to the swelling from the diffusion of unreacted monomers beneath, and if the compressive stress is significantly high, wrinkles appear on the coating’s surface. This work highlights how both skin thickness and elastic modulus impact wrinkle frequency and amplitude. It was demonstrated that these wrinkle parameters can be manipulated in the ternary system by the addition of PBGMA. We also demonstrated that by employing UV irradiation and varying the PBGMA content, it is possible to engineer coatings that range from smooth surfaces with high gloss to wrinkled topographies with a very low associated gloss.",

The results revealed that toughened SAN with small particle sizes possessed better gloss, and the impact strength of the doped small‐particle toughened SAN was much higher than that of the single particle size toughened SAN. The ASA graft powders synthesized from large particle PBA (particle size 316 nm) and small particle PBA (particle size 99 nm), respectively, were mixed at a 50/50 ratio and blended with SAN resin, a gloss level reaching 95, and an impact performance of 275 J/m values almost twice those of a single particle size toughened SAN.\nAcrylonitrile–styrene–acrylate resins with an impact strength of 275 J/m and gloss of 95 were prepared.\nThe balance between mechanical properties and gloss of acrylonitrile–styrene–acrylate resin was obtained.\nPolymerization was initiated at low temperature.\n",

It was found that the ABS doped with the GM stabilizer showed a better yellowing resistance and thermal stability than the ABS doped with other antioxidants. Owing to the fact that the stabilizer can act on the free radicals before it has been peroxidized, it could trap the free radicals as a consequence of directly blocking the oxidation process of the active species, thus solving the problem of oxidative degradation of the materials from the source. This work provides guidance for improving thermal stability of ABS, indicating a promising potential for industrial application.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Slippery coatings, such as the slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS), have gained significant attention for their potential applications in anti-icing and anti-fouling. However, they lack durability when subjected to mechanical impact. In this study, we have developed a robust slippery coating by blending polyurethane acrylate (PUA) with methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) in the solvent of butyl acetate. The resulting mixture is homogeneous and allows for uniform coating on various substrates using a drop coating process followed by drying at 160 °C for 3 h. The cured coating exhibits excellent water repellency (contact angle of ~108° and sliding angle of ~8°), high transparency (average visible transmittance of ~90%), exceptional adherence to the substrate (5B rating according to ASTMD 3359), and remarkable hardness (4H on the pencil hardness scale). Moreover, the coating is quite flexible and can be folded without affecting its wettability. The robustness of the coating is evident in its ability to maintain a sliding angle below 25° even when subjected to abrasion, water jetting, high temperature, and UV irradiation. Due to its excellent nonwetting properties, the coating can be employed in anti-icing, anti-graffiti, and anti-sticking applications. It effectively reduces ice adhesion on aluminum substrates from approximately 217 kPa to 12 kPa. Even after 20 cycles of icing and de-icing, there is only a slight increase in ice adhesion, stabilizing at 40 kPa. The coating can resist graffiti for up to 400 cycles of writing with an oily marker pen and erasing with a tissue. Additionally, the coating allows for easy removal of 3M tape thereon without leaving any residue.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Nickel-rich Li(Ni\n x\n Co\n y\n Mn1–x–y\n O2) (x ≥ 0.6) (NCM) cathodes are regarded as the predominant cathode materials for next-generation Li-ion batteries due to their high specific energy density. However, undesired structural disruption and thermal instability were observed with the increase of Ni content e.g. Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1(NCM811), which are often attributed to the transition metal (TM) ion dissolution, phase change, oxygen release and microcracks formed on the secondary particles during cycling. Therefore, the rapid capacity loss and poor capacity retention have hindered the successful practical applications for NCM811 cathodes. To solve these abovementioned problems, many strategies have been proposed. One of most effective way is to design and explore functional and novel polymer binder materials. Although poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), as the benchmark binder in battery community, has been widely used for decades, lacking of functional groups and poor chemical interactions with the active particles makes it no longer the optimal choice for more challenging cathodes.\n Herein, to explore the possibilities and broaden the range of functional polymers for boosting the performance of NCM811 cathodes, we propose grafting from poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF-CTFE) to obtain PVDF-based polymers with a comb-like architecture, where the PVDF-CTFE was chosen as a substrate backbone to provide the initiating sites for further modification. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), the controlled radical polymerization technique was used to obtain well-controlled grafted chains with low dispersity and desired length and architecture. A random copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PEGMEA-co-PtBA) was first grafted from the PVDF-CTFE backbone, then after hydrolysis of PtBA to poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), the PVDF-CTFE-g-PEGMEA-co-PAA graft copolymers were obtained. Benefiting from the ethylene oxide conductive segments in PEGMEA, the Li ion diffusion and transport was significantly improved. The chelation of TM ions to -COOH groups from PAA would effectively mitigate the TM dissolution and prevent phase transition of NCM811. To test the electrochemical performances of NCM811 cathodes prepared with the designed polymer binder, PVDF and PVDF-CTFE were compared as the control groups in this study. The rate performance of the Li|NCM811 cells showed that PVDF-CTFE-g-PEGMEA-co-PAA binder gave comparable discharge capacities to PVDF and PVDF-CTFE at 0.1C-2C (Figure 1a), however, under 4C with faster charging/discharging, the discharge capacities of PVDF-CTFE-g-PEGMEA-co-PAA were much higher than the two control groups. When increasing the NCM811 weight ratio from 85 wt% to 93 wt%, where the contribution from the conductive carbon is less, the differences were even more significant (Figure 1b). PVDF-CTFE-g-PEGMEA-co-PAA delivered higher capacity at all rates, especially at 2C and 4C, suggesting faster Li ion transport and enhanced electronic properties in the cathodes.\n \n Figure 1.

Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and tip‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), nanoscale insights are provided into the structural organisation and mechanical properties of these hybrid materials. Both the tetrapeptide‐containing block copolymer and a control block copolymer without the peptide linker form wormlike micelles in water. However, the incorporation of the peptide linker alters the micelle morphology by increasing the contour length sixfold compared to the control polymer and by altering the mechanical properties of the wormlike micelles. TERS analysis confirms the presence of ordered β‐sheet structures at the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface, which increase the bending stiffness of the micelles. The introduction of additional secondary interactions, such as those induced by the peptide linker, therefore appears as an interesting lever to manipulate the structure formation and mechanical properties block copolymer micelles, opening up interesting design strategies for tailor‐made hierarchically structured nanomaterials.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Abstract Five randomly cross-linked amphiphilic copolymer networks (ACPN) were prepared via the free radical cross-linking copolymerization of the hydrophobic n-butyl acrylate (BuA) and the hydrophilic N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAAm), in the presence of a small amount (5 mol% with respect to the sum of BuA plus DMAAm monomers) of the hydrophobic 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (HexDA) cross-linker, initiated by 4,4ʹ-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) in 1,4-dioxane at a 10 % w/v total monomer concentration. The five ACPNs differed in their BuA content, fixed at 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 mol%. The two homopolymer networks, BuA and DMAAm, were also prepared using the same polymerization method. Thus, this study involved a total of seven polymer networks, forming a homologous series with BuA contents ranging from 0 to 100 mol%. These networks were characterized in terms of their degrees of swelling in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and water, their mechanical properties in water, and their adhesion to human skin. The degrees of swelling (DS) of the networks in THF were higher than those in water because THF is a non-selective solvent, whereas water is selective for the hydrophilic DMAAm units. The DSs in THF increased with the network content in the less polar BuA units, while the opposite was true for the DSs in water which decreased with the content in the hydrophobic BuA units from 11 (0 mol% BuA) down to 1.1 (100 mol% BuA). A maximum in the elastic modulus was observed for the hydrogel with 50 mol% BuA, reflecting the opposing effects of polymer composition in soft polymer (polyBuA) content and hydrogel water content. In contrast, the tensile strain at break increased monotonically with the hydrogel BuA content, reaching a remarkable ∼900 % for the hydrogel with 90 mol% BuA. Finally, the adhesion of the ACPNs, both in their dried and hydrated states, onto human skin was explored. The adhesion of the hydrated samples onto skin was stronger than that of the dried ones. The hydrated ACPN with 30 mol% BuA exhibited the strongest adhesion onto skin, attributable to the best combination of a rather high content in polar DMAAm units (70 mol%), and a rather low aqueous DS (∼2.5), with the low DS value causing only a small dilution in the DMAAm units participating in the polar interactions with skin. The present work demonstrates that, even in this synthetically simple ACPN system, the multiple effects of ACPN composition on a certain property, in some cases opposing and in some other cooperating, lead to a rather complicated behavior. In particular, as the BuA content increases, some properties display maxima (elastic modulus, stress at break and fracture energy of hydrated ACPNs, and adhesion of hydrated ACPNs onto skin) while some other properties exhibit monotonic increases (strain at break of hydrated ACPNs, and adhesion of dried ACPNs onto skin). Thus, the optimal ACPN for a particular application will highly depend on the property best-serving the particular application, e.g., the ACPNs with 30, 50 and 90 mol% BuA for strongest wet adhesion to skin, stiffest hydrogel response, and highest hydrogel extensibility and toughness, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Background The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of chemo-magnetic hyperthermia (MH), a combination of alternating magnetic field (AMF) and superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with Polyethylene glycol-Poly(butyl acrylate)-Polyethylene glycol (PEG-PBA-PEG) carrying 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu), at inducing apoptosis in the human cancer cell lines HT29 and HCT116. This process can be mediated by alterations in the expression of apoptotic effector proteins, including Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase 3&9, and cleaved PARP, which are involved in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. For this purpose, the cells were cultured as monolayers. Then both cell lines were treated with 5-Fu/magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic hyperthermia. Finally, the effect of treatment on cancer cells was determined by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. Results Our results showed that combined chemo-magnetic thermotherapy significantly increased the apoptosis in colon cancer cells compared to chemotherapy or hyperthermia alone ( P  < 0.05). Up-regulation of Bax, cleaved caspase 3&9, and cleaved PARP proteins was indicative of apoptosis induction in cancer cells, which are involved in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Conclusions This study demonstrates that localized hyperthermia was able to significantly trigger the 5-Fu release and inhibit cell viability, which, due to the synchronization of hyperthermia and chemotherapy, exacerbated the damage of cancer cells.

To enhance FUS-driven actuation efficiency, we propose boron nitride (BN)-infused SMP composites (SMPCs) tailored for targeted biomedical interventions. Using tert-butyl acrylate (tBA) and di(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate as base materials, we integrated BN fillers at varying concentrations (1, 5, and 10 wt.%). A thorough characterization was carried out, including dynamic mechanical analysis, scanning electron microscopy, uniaxial tensile testing, and swelling study. These results show that increasing the BN content improves shape recovery efficiency significantly. Specifically, the 10 wt.% BN composites outperformed plain SMP in terms of shape recovery ratio when activated with FUS, and the highest shape recovery ratio can achieve 75%. However, higher BN content decreases crosslinking density and stiffness, as shown by a lower Young’s modulus and glass transition temperature. This study demonstrates the promise of BN-infused SMPCs for advanced applications in biomedical application, where noninvasive spatiotemporal actuation of SMPs is required.",

The QHB interactions under mechanical stress were investigated by measuring adhesion force using PS-DAN (DAN modified polystyrene), PBMA-DeUG (DeUG modified poly butyl methacrylate) and PBA-UPy (UPy modified poly butyl acrylate) as adhesion promoters. A mechanical lap-shear test was used to evaluate the fracture resistance of QHB heterocomplexes. The maximum load at fail showed that QHB interaction contributed significantly (72%) to overall adhesion. For the QHB modified glass surface, using a polymer modified with its complementary QHB partner greatly facilitated their pairing efficiency, up to 40% for DAN-DeUG. A general method from which single pair ruptures force of QHB modules could be obtained using thermodynamic data obtained from solution chemistry was proposed. Using this method, the single pair rupture force for UPy–UPy was measured as 160 pN, and the single pair rupture force for DAN-DeUG was obtained as 193 pN.",

Herein we report an in depth study of the hierarchical assembly of the amphiphilic cylindrical P-H-P triblock comicelles with polar (P) coronal ends and a hydrophobic (H) central periphery in a selective solvent for the terminal segments which allows access to \"cross\" supermicelles under certain conditions. Well-defined P-H-P triblock comicelles M(PFS-b-PtBA)-b-M(PFS-b-PDMS)-b-M(PFS-b-PtBA) (M = micelle segment, PFS = polyferrocenyldimethylsilane, PtBA = poly(tert-butyl acrylate), and PDMS = polydimethylsiloxane) were created by the living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) method. By manipulating two factors in the supermicelles, namely the H segment-solvent interfacial energy (through the central H segment length, L1) and coronal steric effects (via the PtBA corona chain length in the P segment, L2 related to the degree of polymerization DP2) the aggregation of the triblock comicelles could be finely tuned. This allowed a phase-diagram to be constructed that can be extended to other triblock comicelles with different coronas on the central or end segment where \"cross\" supermicelles were exclusively formed under predicted conditions. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) analysis of dye-labeled \"cross\" supermicelles, and block \"cross\" supermicelles formed by addition of a different unimer to the arm termini, provided complementary characterization to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) and confirmed the existence of these \"cross\" supermicelles as kinetically stable, micron-size colloidally stable structures in solution.",

The cation template-assisted RAFT cyclopolymerization is also effective for the synthesis of amphiphilic random cyclocopolymers bearing hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) rings and hydrophobic butyl groups.

However, a major drawback of these systems is their rapid loss of mechanical properties upon temperature increase. A potential way to circumvent this limitation would be to design ABA triblock copolymers that keep their microphase separation at high temperatures. In this paper, we report on all-soft ABA triblock copolymers having a poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) central block and poly(heptafluorobutyl acrylate) (PHFBA) outer blocks. By introducing fluorinated units, the incompatibility between the blocks is largely increased, allowing strong segregation between the block domains, which preserve the microphase separation up to high temperatures despite the low glass transition temperature of the blocks, as shown by temperature dependent SAXS measurements. We study the properties of different copolymers, with similar PHFBA volume fractions but different block lengths. Linear shear rheology measurements revealed the presence of a second, low frequency, plateau whose onset and length depend on the PnBA and PHFBA length, respectively. This plateau also persists up to higher temperatures for longer PHFBA blocks.",

In this context, copolymerization of β‐Farnesene (Far) with n‐butyl acrylate (BA) using different ratios of BA and Far (100/0, 80/20, and 50/50 wt/wt) is investigated by semi‐bath emulsion polymerization for use in pressure‐sensitive adhesives (PSA). Latexes with different BA and Far contents are obtained with good colloidal stability and a hydrodynamic diameter range of 120–140 nm. The copolymerization between Far and BA is confirmed by FT‐IR and DSC analyses. As the Far content increases, both overall conversion, elongation at break, and loop tack decrease. On the other hand, the lass transition temperature (Tg), gel content, and shear strength increase. The glass transition temperature of copolymers is higher than the theoretical Tg values and is dependent on the Far contents. The use of Far provides additional insights for the production of bio‐based PSAs by emulsion polymerization, which is characterized by an increase in both shear strength and cohesion.

Importantly, the nanocomposite latex undergoes film formation at ambient temperature, thus alleviating any need for high temperature or high pressure methods such as compression molding. The method entails synthesis of an aqueous nanocomposite latex via miniemulsion copolymerization relying on nanodimensional GO sheets as sole surfactant, followed by ambient temperature film formation resulting in homogeneous film. For comparison, a similar latex obtained by physical mixing of a polymer latex with an aqueous GO dispersion results in severe phase separation, illustrating that the miniemulsion approach using GO as surfactant is key to obtaining homogeneous nanocomposite films.

    "abstract": "Because of their high filler loadings, commercial-grade clean flame-retardant materials have unstable mechanical properties. To address this issue, intumescent polymers can be used to develop clean flame retardants with very low levels of smoke and toxicity generation. An intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system composed of red phosphorus (RP), zinc borate (ZB), and a terpolymer of ethylene, butyl acrylate, and maleic anhydride (EBM) was used to prepare EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) and EVA/LLDPE (linear low-density polyethylene) composites; their mechanical and flammability properties were systematically investigated. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) of the EVA/LLDPE (as base material) composite containing RP and ZB mixed with nonhalogenated flame retardant, mainly magnesium hydroxide (MH) and coadditives, including processing aids and thermal stabilizers, was established. RP was found to have little effect on the tensile properties of EVA/LLDPE 118W/120 phr flame-retardant (MH + RP) composites. There was a minute difference in the effective trend of RP between tensile strength and elongation at break. Following the addition of ZB, the elongation at break of the composites gradually decreased with increasing RP content and then leveled off when the RP content was over 10 phr. Mechanical properties (elongation at break and tensile strength) can be best maintained at below 10 phr content of RP. The mechanical properties decreased with lower amounts of EBM content. In addition, flame retardancy increased when the EBM content decreased. The findings further revealed that MH and RP have poor compatibility, yielding poor mechanical properties. The LOI greatly increased with RP content, even though the total content of flame retardants (main + intumescent flame retardant) was the same in all formulations. Only over 5 phr RP content formulations passed V-0 of the UL-94 test. When under 5 phr, the RP content formulations did not pass V-0 of the UL-94 test.",

The impact behavior of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)/ASA binary blends with various ASA terpolymer contents was systematically investigated at three different temperatures (23°C, 0°C, and –30°C). With the addition of 30 phr ASA terpolymer, the impact strength of the blends increased by almost 45 times at 23°C and 29 times at 0°C compared with the neat PVC, respectively. Herein, ASA terpolymer particles were related to each other to form a percolation group and the stress field around the ASA particles was connected with each other, thereby more effectively served as the stress concentrators, exhibiting the highest toughening efficiency. In addition, the significantly improved toughness could also be attributed to the special core-shell structure of ASA terpolymer, as well as, a good miscibility between the PVC matrix and the SAN shell of the ASA terpolymer. However, the decreasing temperature limited the flexibility of the PBA chain, resulting in the insignificant role of ASA terpolymer in toughening PVC at –30°C. Moreover, the improvement in the toughness of the blends did not sacrifice its heat distortion temperature.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The grafting of pH-responsive poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes was carried out on the surface of a commercial TFC-PA membrane using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). Poly(t-butyl acrylate) was polymerized through the SI-ATRP method followed by its acid hydrolysis to form PAA hydrophilic polymer brushes. Surface morphology, permeation flux, salt rejection, and pore sizes were investigated. The contact angle for water was reduced from 50° for a pristine membrane to 27° for the modified membrane due to a modification with the hydrophilic functional group and its brush on membrane surfaces. The flux rate also increased noticeably at lower pH values relative to higher pH for the modified membranes, while the flux remains stable in the case of pristine TFC-PA membranes. There is slight transition in the water flux rate that was also observed when going from pH values of 3 to 5. This was attributed to the pH-responsive conformational changes for the grafted PAA brushes. At these pH values, ionization of the COOH group takes place below and above to influence the effective pore dimension of the modified membranes. At a lower pH value, the PAA brushes seem to permit tight structure conformation resulting in larger pore sizes and hence more flux. On the other hand, at higher pH values, PAA brushes appeared to be in extended conformation to induce smaller pore sizes and result in less flux. Further, pH values were observed to not significantly affect the NaCl salt rejection with values observed in between 98.8% and 95% and close to that of the pristine TFC-PA membranes. These experimental results are significant and have immediate implication for advances in polymer technology to design and modify the “switchable membrane surfaces” with controllable charge distribution and surface wettability, as well as regulation of water flux and salt.",

    "abstract": "The chain-length-dependent nature of the termination reaction in radical polymerization (RP) renders the overall termination rate coefficient, , a complex parameter in the usual situation where the radical chain-length distribution is non-uniform. This applies also for the activation energy of termination, Ea(), which we subject to detailed mechanistic investigation for the first time. The experimental side of this work measures Ea() for the dilute-solution, low-conversion, chemically initiated homopolymerization of styrene (ST), methyl methacrylate (MMA), butyl methacrylate, and dodecyl methacrylate. Values of 25–39 kJ mol−1 are obtained, consistent with strong chain-length-dependent termination (CLDT) for short chains. On other hand, the reanalysis of analogous bulk polymerization data for ST and MMA finds Ea() values of 18–24 kJ mol−1, consistent with weak CLDT for long chains. Both these results are as expected from the so-called composite model for CLDT. A simple analytic framework for understanding and predicting Ea() values is presented for the standard RP situation of continuous initiation. All the results of this work can be rationalized via this framework, which clearly establishes that Ea() is determined by far more than just the Ea of radical diffusion. This framework is extended to activation energy for the number-average degree of polymerization, Ea(DPn), which we measure and successfully scrutinize via our CLDT model. In the final section of this work, we make interesting, testable predictions about Ea() and/or Ea(DPn) in various RP systems of different natures to those studied here, most notably, systems involving acrylates, continuous photoinitiation, or dominant chain transfer.",

Poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate), P(BA-co-MMA), and linear and brush analogs with controlled gradient and statistical sequence were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The effect of sequence on self-healing in BA/MMA copolymer brush particle hybrids followed similar trends as for linear analogs. Most rapid restoration of mechanical properties was found for statistical copolymer sequence; an increase of the high Tg (MMA) component provided a path to raise the material’s modulus while retaining self-heal ability. Creep testing revealed profound differences between linear and brush systems. While linear copolymers featured substantial viscous deformation when exposed to constant stress in the linear regime, brush analogs displayed minimal permanent deformation and featured shape restoration. The reduction of flow was interpreted to be a consequence of slow cooperative relaxation due to the complex microstructure of brush particle hybrids in which long-range motions are constrained through entanglements and slow-diffusing particle cores. The rubbery-like response imparts BA/MMA copolymer brush material systems concurrent “shape-memory” and “self-heal” capability.

To address these challenges, we present a bioinspired solvent-free, dual-network adhesive designed for seamless integration with stretchable materials. We use an ABA triblock copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(n-butyl acrylate)-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA), where PMMA self-assembled microdomains provide structural integrity and the PnBA matrix ensures elasticity and adaptability. A secondary poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) network, polymerized in situ, locks the structure in place and allows for tunable mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 0.17-1.18 MPa) to match different substrates. This architecture enables seam bonds that match the mechanical behavior of the adhered material across a wide range of strains, creating \"mechanically transparent seams\".

    "abstract": "Here, we report a facile methodology to control the sol-gel transition temperature (Tgel) of a physically cross-linked hydrogel by blending two kinds of ABC triblock terpolymers. Well-defined triblock terpolymers including thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm), ABC1, and ABC2, were prepared by sequential reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The chemical structure as well as the molecular weight of the A and B blocks for both polymers are identical, whereas the C blocks are different. The C block of ABC1 (C1) is a statistical copolymer of NIPAAm with hydrophobic n-butyl acrylate (BA), while that of ABC2 (C2) is a PNIPAAm homopolymer. Independently prepared ABC triblock terpolymer solutions exhibit well-defined sol-gel transitions. The Tgel of ABC1 is lower than that of ABC2 since hydrophobic BA is copolymerized into block C1. Remarkably, the Tgel varies linearly within this temperature range by simply blending the two polymers, while the resultant gel strength (∼G') remains almost unchanged. Therefore, the Tgel can be precisely adjusted by the mixing ratio of the two polymers. This method for straightforward manipulation of Tgel has great potential for various soft material applications such as biomaterials for tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, and injectable gels.",

In contrast to the conventional thick, dense gel polymer coating layer, a thin P(AALi‐co‐BA) layer was formed on the PP separator, which had less influence on the pore structure of the original PP separator and was beneficial for the migration of lithium ions through the separator. Furthermore, the AALi units in the copolymer could improve the wettability of the separator, while the BA units provided the separator with strong adhesion to the electrodes. As expected, the modified separators showed good wettability, high ionic conductivity, and excellent interface stability. In addition, the cycle stability and rate performance were also improved significantly.

    "abstract": "The need for the production of synthetic polymers from renewable and sustainable resources also affects the area of emulsion polymerization. The bio-based monomer (BBM) was synthesized from camelina oil (CO) and itaconic acid through transesterification and epoxidation of CO, followed by itaconation, resulting in a blend of methyl esters of CO-originated fatty acids functionalized with reactive methyl itaconate groups. Various amounts of BBM (0−30 wt% of BBM in the total monomer mixture) were copolymerized with standard petroleum-based acrylic monomers (specifically methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, and methacrylic acid) using the emulsion polymerization technique to obtain film-forming latexes. Infrared and Raman spectroscopies evidenced the successful incorporation of BBM into the structure of latex polymers. The ultra-high molar mass nanogel fraction was detected by asymmetric flow-field flow fractionation coupled with a multiangle light scattering (AF4-MALS) for the BBM comprising copolymers; the higher the BBM content, the more extensive the nanogel fraction. Cross-linking of latex polymers induced by BBM testified to the reactivity of itaconated functions in emulsion polymerization and provided additional evidence of the copolymerization ability of BBM. The incorporation of BBM also resulted in pendulum hardness and glass transition temperature enhancement (about 11% and 9 °C, respectively, in the case of 30 wt% of BBM content in contrast to 0 wt% of BBM content in the copolymer). Coatings with excellent transparency and gloss were obtained from all latexes regardless of the BBM content used. Slightly increased water repellency (about 7 ° increased water contact angle value) and significantly improved water whitening resistance of the coatings (about 80% decreased water whitening after 1-day long water exposure) were found for coatings comprising 30 wt% of BBM in the copolymer, where the water whitening phenomenon was highly dependent on the BBM content.",

Nine different zwitterions were synthesized and fully characterized. Zwitterions with the poor Michael acceptors methyl methacrylate and methyl crotonate formed, but could not be isolated in pure form. The solid-state structures of two phosphonium phenolate molecules were determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The bonding situation in the solid state together with NMR data suggests an important contribution of an ylidic resonance structure in these molecules. The phosphonium phenolates are characterized by UV–vis absorptions peaking around 360 nm and exhibit a negative solvatochromism. An analysis of the kinetics of the zwitterion formation was performed for three Michael acceptors (acrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, and acrylamide) in two different solvents (chloroform and methanol). The results revealed the proton transfer step necessary to stabilize the initially formed carbanion as the rate-determining step. A preorganization of the carbonyl bearing Michael acceptors allowed for reasonable fast direct proton transfer from the phenol in aprotic solvents. In contrast, acrylonitrile, not capable of forming a similar preorganization, is hardly reactive in chloroform solution, while in methanol the corresponding phosphonium phenolate is formed.",

To increase the crystallinity of coir fiber, the study describes an easy-to-use, simple-to-implement method that is cost-effective, eco-friendly, and highly productive. With the help of dodecyl methacrylate disperson, hydrocarbon molecules of varying chain lengths are covalently attached to the surface of coir fibers, modulating their surface wettability. There are a few different long-chain hydrocarbon compounds employed, including n-butyl methacrylate, n-octyl acrylate, and dodecyl methacrylate (DM), but DM has shown to be the most effective. The degree of grafting yield alteration is determined gravimetrically. It has been found that grafting yields of 28–30 wt.% can be used to convert hydrophilic coir fibers into water repellent crystalline fibers (water contact angle 148°). A total of 15 nm of dispersion, a disperson rate of 2 nm/min, DM concentration of 20%, and water content of 10% are fixed as key reaction parameters.

Colloid Interface Sci. 2018, 528, 289-300).Depending on synthesis conditions, the extent of nanoparticle attachment could be varied; however, the mechanism behind this attachment during latex growth remained unclear. The dual population of particles present (silica + polymer) means that particle sizing by dynamic light scattering is ambiguous. Furthermore, the low glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymers such as poly(butyl acrylate) (pBA) typically used in film-forming applications for decorative coatings (i.e., paints) means that the hybrid latex particles are too \"soft\" for robust analysis through atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Here, we show that small- and ultrasmall-angle neutron scattering (SANS and USANS), along with complementary data from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), reveals that these armored hybrid latex particles adopt a raspberry-type configuration, supporting their core-shell structure. The number of nanoparticles present on the surface of the hybrid latex can be adjusted by addition of one of a diverse range of alkyl- or perfluoroalkyl-silanes to alter silica nanoparticle hydrophobicity, and quantified through analysis of scattering data.

In this work, the synthesis of a functional terpene-containing acrylate monomer (tetrahydrogeraniol acrylate, THGA) is reported. This monomer was polymerized in toluene and bulk via free-radical polymerizations, achieving high conversion and molecular weights up to 278 kg·mol-1. The synthesized poly(THGA) shows a relatively low Tg (-46 °C), making it useful as a replacement for low Tg acrylic monomers, such as the widely used n-butyl acrylate. RAFT polymerization in toluene ([M]0 = 3.6 mol·L-1) allowed for the well-controlled polymerization of THGA with degrees of polymerization (DP n) from 25 to 500, achieving narrow molecular weight distributions ( D̵ ≈ 1.2) even up to high conversions. At lower monomer concentrations ([M]0 = 1.8 mol·L-1), some evidence of intramolecular chain transfer to polymer was seen by the detection of branching (arising from propagation of midchain radicals) and terminal double bonds (arising from β-scission of midchain radicals). Poly(THGA) was subsequently utilized for the synthesis of poly(THGA)- b-poly(styrene)- b-poly(THGA) and poly(styrene)- b-poly(THGA)- b-poly(styrene) triblock copolymers, demonstrating its potential as a component of thermoplastic elastomers.

Gel content in the crosslinked portion was examined by Soxhlet extraction, whilst the soluble molecular weight of PSAs was characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The viscoelastic properties of polymer films were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The Tg value and storage modulus (G′) of the PSAs were enhanced with the addition of HDDA.

    "abstract": "Abstract The behavior of different polymerizable surfactants was investigated to improve the water-resistance of pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) based on acrylic acid (AA) and n-butyl acrylate (n-BA). Differences in the adhesion properties were found according to the chemical structure and the critical micelle concentration of the polymerizable surfactant, especially when compared to the non-polymerizable reference surfactant (Dowfax 2A1). The polymerizable surfactants with a branched structure resulted in more gel content and higher glass transition temperature in the adhesive. In general, the peel resistance and tack properties decreased with the use of polymerizable surfactants in the PSA formula. However, increased shear resistance was observed with respect to the PSA adhesive synthesized with the reference surfactant. Furthermore, the adhesives made with higher molecular weight polymerizable surfactants resulted in higher shear elastic modulus, shear strength, and deformation energy than the rest of the PSA adhesives. On the other hand, as expected, all the polymerizable surfactants studied contributed to the improved water resistance of the PSA compared to the reference PSA prepared with a conventional surfactant. The covalent bond formed between the polymer and the surfactant limited the migration of the surfactant towards the air-film interface thus reducing the formation of water entry pathways. The polymerizable surfactants with linear molecular structure showed the best water resistance performance.",

    "abstract": "Epoxy adhesives become very brittle after curing due to their high‐crosslinking degree. For increasing the toughness of epoxy adhesives, the addition of different toughening agents has been proposed. In this study the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA)/dicyandiamide epoxy network has been modified by adding an emulsion latex containing core–shell rubber particles (CSPs) prepared by means of seeded emulsion polymerization. The CSPs consist of poly (butyl acrylate) (PBA) as core and methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymerized with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) as shell. The effects of adding various amounts of the emulsion latex on the mechanical properties, thermal stability, adhesion, and microstructure of the cured epoxy resin were investigated. The CSPs were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The mechanical properties, thermal stability, adhesion to aluminum plates, and microstructure of the cured epoxy resin were investigated by stress–strain, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), single lap shear test, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. The addition of 7 wt.% emulsion latex to epoxy enhanced the tensile strength and the toughness of the dumbbell‐shaped samples by 421% and 4388% with respect to neat epoxy, respectively. Furthermore, the single lap shear strength increased in 33% and an increase of 71°C in the initial decomposition temperature of the epoxy was obtained by adding 7 wt.% CSP, without affecting the maximum decomposition temperature. The FESEM micrographs of the fractured surfaces indicated that the major toughening mechanisms were CSP de‐bonding, plastic void growth, and shear bond yielding.",

The PBAS was applied as a dispersant for waterborne TiO2 paste to prepare waterborne inkjet ink. The successful synthesis of PBAS was confirmed by FTIR and 1H-NMR. To evaluate the printability and storage properties of pastes and inks, we characterized the particles, particle distribution, the storage modulus, viscosity, precipitation coefficient, and delamination height. The method creatively used in our study to characterize the printing smoothness of the ink in the industrial practical application was the filter rate of ink. We also proposed a method of using soft and hard precipitation to characterize the precipitation situation. The results of the experiment indicated that compared with commercial dispersants, PBAS5/6 had excellent performance in printing flow and anti-settling performance. This paper demonstrates the optimum dispersibility of PBAS was obtained when the molecular weight was 8500, the acid value was 100 mg KOH/g, and the 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS) content was 20%.

    "abstract": "Introduction The most commonly encountered industrial method to obtain copolymers is by radical initiation. In spite of diversity of the modern molecular design methods, such as complex-radical processes, pseudo-living radical polymerization, etc. [13], the problem of characteristics modification for polymer materials using development of copolymer synthesis without additives, with classical radical initiators, is of as great importance as before. One of such methods is compensate copolymerization, which involves fractional introduction of one of the monomers into the reaction sphere. In this way it is possible to obtain copolymers differing in composition from the monomer mixture, therefore, possessing new characteristic features. In the series of papers [47] the results were presented, concerning application of the compensate copolymerization method to obtain structurally uniform copolymers of vinyl alkyl ethers (VAE) with alkyl(meth)acrylates (AMA). The advantages of the chosen method were shown compared to synthesis from a monomer mixture, enabling the synthesis of gradient copolymers. Butyl acrylate (BA) was mostly used as the model monomer couple in order to study the synthesis features. The aim of the present paper is the investigation of compensate radical copolymerization of vinyl monomers demonstrated by the example of monomer couples including butyl methacrylate (BMA), specifically, BMA – vinyl butyl ether (VBE), BMA – vinyl isobutyl ether (ViBE), BMA – styrene.",

    "abstract": "Conventional methods for preparing Janus nanosheets, including graphene oxide-based nanosheets, molybdenum disulfide-based nanosheets, and silicon dioxide-based nanosheets, as well as polymer-based nanosheets, involve complicated procedures, poor repeatability, and difficulty in imparting Janus properties, which hinder further application. Here, the present authors develop a facile modified suspension polymerization method for preparing Janus polymer nanosheets, in which deep eutectic solvents completely replace water as the continuous phase. Janus polymer nanosheets can be fabricated using common hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, such as styrene (St), butyl acrylate (BA), acrylamide (AM), 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS), acryloyloxyethyl trimethylammonium chloride (DAC), and maleic anhydride (MAH). Additionally, the thickness of the Janus polymer nanosheets can be precisely controlled in a range from 40 to 100 nm by adjusting the volume ratio of higher alkanes to the hydrophobic monomer. Subsequently, the emulsification properties of polystyrene-based nanosheets were evaluated, showing better performance at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 mg/L compared with higher concentrations. This observation aligns with the corresponding reduction in interfacial tension and changes in the moduli of the interfacial film. Moreover, the adsorption of the nanosheets onto the core alters its wettability, changing it from a water-wettable state to an oil-wettable state. Consequently, a series of core flooding tests reveal that the poly(St-co-AM), poly(St-co-MAH), and poly(St-co-AMPS) nanosheets enhance oil recovery and reduce injection pressure at ultralow concentrations (50 mg/L).",

    "abstract": "Painting antifouling coatings is one of the most important methods to prevent marine biofouling. Acrylic resin is widely used in marine antifouling because of its excellent stickiness, water resistance, and film-forming capabilities. At present, the widely used acrylate antifouling coatings require a high concentration of cuprous oxide as antifoulant. The release and accumulation of copper ions are the main factors affecting the marine environment. In this study, BIT–allyl methacrylate (BM) and zinc acrylate (ZM) were selected as functional monomers copolymerized with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl acrylate (BA) to prepare a series of BIT acrylate antifouling resins. The inhibitory effects of all resins against marine bacteria (S. aureus, V. coralliilyticus, and V. parahaemolyticus), marine algae (Chlorella, I. galbana, and C. curvisetus), and barnacle larvae were studied. Moreover, marine field tests on the BIT modified resin in coastal waters were conducted. The results demonstrate that the grafted BIT–zinc acrylate resin not only exhibits excellent antifouling properties but also a significant self-polishing performance, providing a novel strategy to design a long-term antifouling resin with stable antifoulant release.",

Here, LA of ethylene‐butyl acrylate (EBA) filled with different volume fractions (4%, 8%, and 20%) of CB particles is studied. Upon irradiation with the second harmonics (532 nm) of the nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser, a structuration is evidenced at the sample surface in a restricted range of fluence and at high pulse number (PN) (500 pulses, 1 Hz). The laser‐ablated surface is analyzed by microtopography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Collectively, our data show a lowering in ablation threshold and depth for CB volume fractions larger than the conduction threshold (8%), indicating that visible radiation primarily induces photothermal effects. After redeposition of the ablation products at the surface, XPS indicates that high CB content in the EBA matrix induces high oxidation level of the composite surface. Furthermore, our results reveal that LA produces a significant proportion of amorphous carbon. Several parameters which affect heat accumulation and CB particle shielding are discussed. Such parameters include laser fluence and repetition rate, and CB content.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This paper presents studies on the influence of the chemical structure of (meth)acrylic monomers on the properties of powder coatings based on polyacrylate resins. For this purpose, a wide range of monomers were selected—2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), n-butyl acrylate (nBA), tert-butyl acrylate (tBA), dodecyl acrylate (DA), ethyl acrylate (EA) and benzyl acrylate (BAZ)—for the synthesis of the polyacrylate resin. The average molecular mass and molecular mass distribution of the synthesized resins were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The glass transition temperature (Tg) and viscosity of polyacrylate resins were determined by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and a Brookfield viscometer. These parameters were necessary to obtain information about storage stability and behavior during the application of powder clear coatings. Additionally, DSC was also used to checked the course of the low-temperature curing reaction between the hydroxyl group contained in the polyacrylate resin and the blocked polyisocyanate group derived from a commercial agent such as Vestanat B 1358/100. The properties of the cured powder clear coatings were tested, such as: roughness, gloss, adhesion to the steel surface, hardness, cupping, scratch resistance, impact resistance and water contact angle. The best powder clear coating based on the polyacrylate resin L_HEMA/6MMA/0.5nBA/0.5DA was characterized as having good scratch resistance (550 g) and adhesion to the steel surface, a high water contact angle (93.53 deg.) and excellent cupping (13.38 mm).

Dextrin/starch -graft- poly(butyl acrylate -co- styrene) copolymers have been synthesized by radical graft copolymerization and their structure and mechanical properties are reported. High molecular weight grafted chains formation is favored, leading to a low degree of substitution of starch hydroxyl groups. Wide-Angle-X-ray Scattering (WAXS) analysis indicates that all materials are amorphous and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) investigations reveal a two-phase morphology. This is further confirmed by the presence of two glass transitions, one related to the starch/dextrin macromolecules and sensitive to water content, and one assigned to the grafted polymers that is composition dependent. Water uptake is controlled by dextrin/starch content but diffusivity increases with the butyl acrylate ratio. The mechanical behavior is dependent on monomer ratio, and water content. Increasing butyl acrylate ratio improves the ductility of the sample while materials become brittle as soon as styrene ratio is predominant in the grafted chains. While no effect of molecular weight of starch substrate on structure and thermal behavior is evidenced, dextrin-based materials are slightly more ductile than starch-based ones. The interest of using dextrin instead of starch is further highlighted by a lower viscosity of the reactive medium, together with an improved processability, as structural materials can be obtained over a wider range of composition than with native starch.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "All-solid-state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as one of the most viable energy storage devices and their comprehensive properties are mainly controlled by solid electrolytes and interface compatibility. This work proposes an advanced poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) based gel polymer electrolyte (AP-GPEs) via functional superposition strategy, which involves incorporating butyl acrylate and polyethylene glycol diacrylate as elastic optimization framework, triethyl phosphate and fluoroethylene carbonate as flameproof liquid plasticizers, and Li7 La3 Zr2 O12 nanowires (LLZO-w) as ion-conductive fillers, endowing the designed AP-GPEs/LLZO-w membrane with high mechanical strength, excellent flexibility, low flammability, low activation energy (0.137 eV), and improved ionic conductivity (0.42 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 20 °C) due to continuous ionic transport pathways. Additionally, the AP-GPEs/LLZO-w membrane shows good safety and chemical/electrochemical compatibility with the lithium anode, owing to the synergistic effect of LLZO-w filler, flexible frameworks, and flame retardants. Consequently, the LiFePO4 /Li batteries assembled with AP-GPEs/LLZO-w electrolyte exhibit enhanced cycling performance (87.3% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 1 C) and notable high-rate capacity (93.3 mAh g-1 at 5 C). This work proposes a novel functional superposition strategy for the synthesis of high-performance comprehensive GPEs for LMBs.",

    "doi": "10.1002/amp2.10061",
    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed fragilities and reinforced the resiliency of different elements of our manufacturing and processing systems. Food processing, in particular meat packing, currently a very labor-intensive operation, experienced significant disruption and the car industry implemented shutdowns which will ripple through supply chains in the coming months. It became clear that packaging supply chains are bottlenecks as producers tried to divert food stuffs from restaurants to consumer stores, and shifts in demand for paper products caused persistent consumer outages. The basic chemicals and fuels industry did not see significant disruption, but wild price fluctuations did occur as reduced demands and an unfortunately timed production increase caused available storage capacity to be strained. Recycling industries saw, and will continue to experience, both ends of the disruption as their consuming industries reduced demand and their providers stockpiled material or diverted it to trash. The beverage industry has significant inventory in public venues that has expired. Boutique level hand sanitizer production has resulted as these beverage production systems have been reconfigured and the rules surrounding the grade of alcohol relaxed. We are sure there are many of you who have worked long hours to innovate your manufacturing and processing systems to cope with the challenges of COVID-19 and we would welcome articles and commentaries on how advanced manufacturing can play a role in our collective response. In this issue of JAMP we share a commentary on the rapid manufacturing of vaccines as our contribution to understanding how our community might respond to COVID-19, and we would like to encourage you to consider other ways in which our manufacturing systems will change in response to the pandemic. However, much as there is a need to address the short-term disruptions caused by a pandemic, and to understand how research can respond to create advanced manufacturing and processing systems with flexibility and resilience in the future, we also need to continue to push forward with efforts that provide new foundations for those features and we have curated articles that we hope fulfill that goal. Process intensification remains a key approach to advanced manufacturing enabling more nimble and responsive systems. This issue provides two examples tackling a variety of processes: the epoxidation of vegetable oils and the manufacturing of butyl acrylate. Rahim et al. show that by using a mesoscale oscillating baffled reactor the process can be converted from a batch operation to a continuous one and in the process they estimate that the new reactor is approximately 144 times smaller than the batch reactor operating at the same production rate. The Simulated Moving Bed Reactor (SMBR) technology has been an example for process intensification for a couple of decades. Constantino et al. have combined this technology with membrane pervaporation creating a Simulated Moving Bed Membrane Reactor which reduces the number of operation sections for the manufacturing of butyl acrylate while reducing the eluent consumption and improving the productivity. A complete analysis of all process metrics is given in this paper. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the chemical process industry is being used in new ways that are challenging the way this industry should consider the adoption and deployment of Industry 4.0 that has become ubiquitous in other business sectors. Colegrove discusses the importance of protecting data as critical intellectual capital and how many in the AI vendor community do not understand the value of data to the process industry. The commentary offers insight on the need for chemical engineers and data scientists to work closely together to solve technical and operational problems that require analysis of data that is broader than process data and where fundamental models break down. This commentary takes on additional importance for resiliency in light of the social and economic impact of COVID-19.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "The development of a highly active, long-lasting, and cost-effective electrocatalyst as an alternative to platinum (Pt) is a vital issue for the commercialization of dye-sensitized solar cells. In this study, Ru-N-doped template-free mesoporous carbon (Ru-N-TMC) was prepared by the direct stabilization and carbonization of the poly(butyl acrylate)-b-polyacrylonitrile (PBA-b-PAN) block copolymer and ruthenium(iii) acetylacetonate [Ru(acac)3]. During the stabilization process, microphase separation occurred in the PBA-b-PAN block copolymer due to the incompatibility between the two blocks, and the PAN block transformed to N-doped semi-graphitic carbon. In the carbonization step, the PBA block was eliminated as a porous template, creating hierarchal mesopores/micropores. Meanwhile, Ru(acac)3 was decomposed to Ru, which was homogeneously distributed over the carbon substrate and anchored through N and O heteroatoms. The resulting Ru-N-TMC showed ultra-low charge transfer resistance (Rct = 0.034 Ω cm2) in the Co(bipyridine)33+/2+ reduction reaction, indicating very high electrocatalytic ability. Even though it is a transparent counter electrode (CE, average visible transmittance of 42.25%), covering a small fraction of the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrate with Ru-N-TMC, it led to lower charge transfer resistance (Rct = 0.55 Ω cm2) compared to Pt (Rct = 1.00 Ω cm2). The Ru-N-TMC counter electrode exhibited a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42% compared to Pt (11.16%) when employed in SGT-021/Co(bpy)33+/2+ based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Furthermore, a remarkable PCE of 10.13% and 8.64% from front and rear illumination, respectively, was obtained when the Ru-N-TMC counter electrode was employed in a bifacial DSSC. The outstanding catalytic activity and PCE of Ru-N-TMC were due to the high surface area of Ru-N-TMC, which contained numerous active species (Ru and N), easily facilitated to redox ions through the hierarchical microporous/mesoporous structure.",

The stability of the latexes was tested by determining the values of non‐overt and overt coagulation thresholds. The values of the limiting equivalent conductivity and the anode zeta potential were determined. The relative hardness of latex membranes and their mass change after hot water extraction were investigated. The relationships between the properties of individual latexes were established.

Utilizing dynamic hindered urea chemistry, a new method for the melt‐functionalization of cellulose nanocrystals has been developed. This method does not require toxic solvents during the grafting step and can achieve grafting densities competitive with state‐of‐the‐art solution‐based grafting methods. Using cotton‐sourced, TEMPO‐oxidized CNCs, multiple molecular weights of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as well as dodecane, polycaprolactone, and poly(butyl acrylate) were grafted to the CNC surface. With PEG‐grafted nanoparticles, grafting densities of 0.47 chains nm−2 and 0.10 chains nm−2 were achieved with 2000 and 10,000 g mol−1 polymer chains respectively, both of which represent significant improvements over previous reports for solution‐based PEG grafting onto CNCs.",

After the modifications, the architecture of the obtained alternating MMA/BA copolymers was compared with gradient and statistical copolymers with overall similar compositions, molecular weights, and dispersities. 13C NMR indicated the absence of either MMA/MMA/MMA or BA/BA/BA sequences, in contrast to an abundance of homotriads in either the statistical or especially in the gradient copolymer.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "In the world’s transition to a sustainable society, it is urgent to develop advanced lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with significantly improved electrochemical performance. Such improvements can be achieved through the use of advanced electrode materials with high capacity (high energy density), such as Ni-rich LiNi\n xCo\n \n yMn\n 1-x-y\n O2 (NCM, x≥0.6), 5-volt LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) spinel positive, and Si-based negative electrodes. However, these materials face significant challenges, such as severe electrolyte decomposition at elevated voltages, interfacial parasitic reactions, and large volume changes. To overcome these issues, we have focused on developing effective polymer binders for advanced LIBs.\n Herein, we report the chemistry of aqueous-based polymer binders containing specific functional groups, referred to as “functional aqueous binders”, with a particular focus on interfacial chemistry in advanced LIB electrode materials. The key findings of this study are highlighted as follows (illustrated in the figures below): \n \n partially-neutralized crosslinked sodium polyacrylate (CLPA) binders with flexible monomers for Si/SiO negative electrodes\n \n \n sulfated alginate (ALG) binders for 5-volt LNMO spinel positive electrodes\n \n \n styrene acrylic rubber (SAR) binders with a copolymerization of butyl acrylate monomers for Ni-rich NCM positive electrodes.\n \n \n \n Notably, all the functional binders reported in this study are categorized as aqueous binders, which can be dissolved in water, in contrast to traditional polyvinylidene fluoride binders that require dissolution in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, a volatile and toxic organic solvent known for its environmental hazards.\n Although binders have a variety of effects in the battery operation, this study specifically emphasizes their influence on interfacial reactions. For instance, we found that sulfated ALG uniformly covers the surface of LNMO and increased its affinity for the electrolyte owing to the high polarity of the sulfate group. The electrolyte decomposition products generated in the initial charge-discharge cycle on the ALG-covered electrode participated in the formation of a protective passivation layer that suppressed further decomposition during subsequent cycles, resulting in enhanced cycling and rate performances. We hope that these strategies for functional aqueous binders will further facilitate the future development of advanced LIBs by controlling the electrode reaction via binder chemistry.\n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1\n",

Here, nonvolatile, highly transparent, and ultrastretchable ionic conductors based on polymeric gelators [poly(methyl methacrylate‐ran‐butyl acrylate), PMMA‐r‐PBA] and ionic liquids (IL) are proposed. A crucial strategy in the molecular design of polymer gelators is copolymerization of PMMA and IL‐insoluble low glass transition temperature (Tg) polymers that can be deformed and effectively dissipate applied strains. Highly stretchable (elongation limit ≈850%), mechanically robust (elastic modulus ≈3.1 × 105 Pa), and deformation durable (recovery ratio ≈96.1% after 500 stretching/releasing cycles) gels are obtained by judiciously adjusting the molecular characteristics of polymer gelators and gel composition. An extremely simple “ionic” strain sensory platform is fabricated by directly connecting the stretchable gel and a digital multimeter, exhibiting high sensitivity (gauge factor ≈2.73), stable operation (>13 000 cycles), and nonvolatility (>10 d in air). Moreover, the skin‐type strain sensor, referred to as ionoskin, is demonstrated.

Under optimized conditions, the result of elongation at break of NR/SBR composites combined with 1.5 parts per hundred rubber (phr) O-MWCNTs is 450% compared to 376% of pristine NR/SBR composites, which is proportional to tensile strength due to the mixed O-MWCNTs in the rubber matrix. Transmission electron microscopy study shows that O-MWCNTs (1.5 phr) can disperse uniformly in NR/SBR/O-MWCNT composites. A scanning electron microscopy study on the fractured surface morphology of the optimized composites reveals that a BA-MMA-GMA terpolymer can interact with the rubber matrix strongly. The decreased height of the maximum tanδ peak shows that O-MWCNTs can reduce the heat buildup and damping capability of NR/SBR/O-MWCNT composites. The largest enhancement observed in the thermal degradation curves of composites is, for the first time, about 70°C, which can be attributed to enhanced interfacial interaction between MWCNTs and the rubber matrix.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "\n A 52-year-old woman presented to dermatology with severe widespread dermatitis, characterized by spongiosis on a recent skin biopsy. Despite thorough investigation, a definitive cause remained elusive. The patient underwent patch testing with the baseline, photopatch, anti-infective, excipient, cosmetic, textile, fragrance and acrylate series. Patch testing revealed multiple positive 3+ blistering reactions to various acrylates: 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butanediol dimethacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate and triethylene glycol diacrylate. The patient lacked any direct exposure to acrylates through common sources such as gel, shellac or acrylic nails; dental materials; dressings or bone cement. Further inquiry revealed that the husband’s profession was in windscreen repairs, where he routinely handled resins containing acrylates, which he would wipe on to his work overall. It emerged that the transfer of resin onto his clothing, subsequently laundered alongside the patient’s own clothes, likely facilitated sensitization. Analysis of the husband’s work-related resin products confirmed the presence of several acrylates implicated in the patient’s patch test reactions. Given the severity of her symptoms, including blistering reactions, a consort allergic contact dermatitis (CACD) to occupational acrylates was strongly suspected. Following counselling on allergen avoidance strategies, the patient consciously avoided close contact with her partner’s work clothing and began laundering her garments separately. Remarkably, this intervention led to complete resolution of her symptoms. CACD, also referred to as connubial contact dermatitis, is a recognized phenomenon wherein one develops allergic reactions to allergens originating from another individual. A recent systematic review reported a female predominance (62.8%) in cases of CACD, with partners or spouses being the most common consorts (50.0%) (Lee J, Guo S, Dinalo J et al. Consort allergic contact dermatitis: a systematic review. Dermatitis 2022; 33: 181–6). Exposure from a partner’s occupation was noted in a subset of cases (14.6%), underscoring the relevance of occupational history in such presentations. A caregiving relationship was also frequently involved. This case represents the one of the first documented instances of CACD attributed to occupational acrylates. It highlights the need for comprehensive social and occupational history taking in dermatology settings. It underscores the importance of considering potential sources of allergen exposure from partners or dependants, particularly in cases with unusual clinical presentations.",

Under acidic conditions, at the low ionic strength of NaCl solution (0.15 mol/L), the monolayer isotherm of the copolymer appears at large mean molecular areas (mmA) due to the destruction of the hydration of tertiary amine groups in the PDMAEA blocks. At its middle and high ionic strengths (0.30 and 0.60 mol/L), the isotherms are close to that without salt due to the interfacial shrinkage of the PDMAEA blocks resulting from their complete electrostatic shielding. With increasing the ionic strength of Na2SO4 solutions, the isotherms move to larger mmA values. Under alkaline conditions, the interfacial stretching degrees of the hydrophilic blocks increase with the concentrations of Na2SO4, NaSCN, and NaNO3 solutions (0.10-1.00 mol/L). Under different salt conditions, the Langmuir-Blodgett films of the copolymer exhibit separate circular micelles.

Thus, it can be provided new raw materials to many sectors, especially textile, automotive and electronic products, by preparing biodegradable, environmentally friendly materials with better performance properties. PLA/PBT blends containing 5%, 10%, and 15% PBT by weight were produced in a twin screw extruder using with using maleic anhydride grafted ethylene/butyl acrylate (EBA-g-MAH) as a compatibilizer. For comparison studies, blends of PLA/PBT without compatibilizer were also prepared. Examinations on the flow, viscoelastic properties, and rheologic characteristics of prepared samples were carried out by using Melt Flow Index values and Rotational Rheometer measurements. Mechanical and impact resistance characteristics were identified in accordance with the relevant standards. Physical properties of blends such as molding shrinkage, density, and hardness values were also determined. Degradation or cross-linking-induced changes in the chain structure was not observed during the investigation via using a rotational rheometer for PBT samples at 240 °C /15 min., and PLA samples at 260 °C /15 min. Notched izod impact test results show that adding compatibilizer increases 16% impact resistance of PLA/PBT blends.

    "year": 2017,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACTPoly(siloxane‐ether‐urethane)‐acrylic (PU‐AC) hybrid emulsions were prepared by introducing different hydroxyethoxypropyl‐terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) content into the acrylic‐terminated poly(ether‐urethane) backbone and then in situ copolymerizing with methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate via emulsion process. The effects of PDMS on the particle size and viscoelastic behavior of the hybrid emulsions were investigated. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonding, mechanical and thermal mechanical properties, water resistance, the surface gloss, and wettability of the resultant hybrid films were also studied. The results showed that all the hybrid emulsions showed shear‐thinning behaviors, and the introduction of PDMS resulted in the formation of the hybrid emulsions with increased average particle size and decreased viscosity. The chemical bonds built between PU and AC yielded higher than 73% crosslinking fraction in all the hybrid materials, but this value decreased with increasing PDMS content because PDMS reduced the hydrogen bonding interactions and enhanced the phase separation. As a result, an increase in the PDMS content led to an increase in the elongation, water resistance, surface roughness, and water hydrophobic of the films, but the tensile strength, hardness, storage modulus, and glass transitions temperature decreased. It is suggested that introduction of PDMS can provide the hybrid materials with the improved flexibility, water resistance, and surface hydrophobicity, which has potential application value in the fouling‐release coatings, biomaterials, and surface fishing. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Delivery of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells using polymeric micelles is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, limited stability of micelles, premature drug release and off-target effect are the major obstacles that restrict the utilization of polymeric micelles as effective drug delivery systems. In this work, we addressed these issues through the innovative design of targeted pH-sensitive crosslinked polymeric micelles for chemotherapeutic delivery. A well-defined triblock copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(butyl acrylate) (PEG-b-PHEMA-b-PBA), was synthesized by living radical polymerization, and then modified by using 4-pentenoic anhydride to incorporate pendant crosslinkable alkene groups in the middle block. The resulting copolymer underwent self-assembly in aqueous solution to form non-crosslinked micelles (NCMs). Subsequently, intramicellar thiol–ene crosslinking was performed by using 1,4-butanediol bis(3-mercaptopropionate) to give crosslinked micelles (CMs) with pH-sensitive crosslinks. The targeted CM (cRGD-DOX10-CM5) was readily prepared by using tumor-targeting ligand cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys) (cRGD) together with the 1,4-butanediol bis(3-mercaptopropionate) during the crosslinking step. The study of cumulative DOX release revealed the pH-sensitive feature of drug release from these CMs. An in vitro MTT assay revealed that NCMs and CMs are biocompatible with MCF 10A cells, and the samples exhibited significant therapeutic efficiency as compared to free DOX. Cellular uptake studies confirmed higher uptake of cRGD-DOX10-CM5 by MCF 10A cancer cells via cRGD-receptor-mediated endocytosis as compared to the corresponding analogues without cRGD. These results indicate that such pH-responsive crosslinked PEG-b-PHEMA-b-PBA-based micelles are therapeutically effective against cancer cells and hold remarkable promise to act as smart drug delivery systems for cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The ionogel polymer electrolyte (IGPE) has emerged as a promising polymer electrolyte for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to its high safety and a wide electrochemical window. To achieve an energy density comparable to that of liquid electrolyte (LEs)-based cells, ultrathin IGPE electrolytes with high Li+ conductance are desired. However, their development still suffers from intrinsically poor mechanical stability and the low Li+ transference number (tLi+) of IGPEs. Here, we design a 12 μm-thick, mechanically reliable, and highly Li+ conductive IGPE electrolyte (PET-IGPE) by incorporating a poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA)/solvate ionic liquid (SIL)-based ionogel with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) track-etched membrane. The PET membrane as the scaffold enables the resultant IGPE electrolyte to have a high tensile strength of 65 MPa and a puncture strength of >340 gf mil-1, preventing the Li symmetrical cell from short-circuiting for over 700 h of cycling. Meanwhile, the vertically aligned pores in the PET membrane function as the directional Li+ motion pathway, which enables an ultrahigh areal ionic conductance of 308.3 mS cm-2, improves tLi+ to 0.61, and steady Li plating/stripping without impairing the thermal and electrochemical oxidative stability of IGPEs. As a result, the Li|12PET-IGPE|LiFePO4 cell shows high capacity, high cycling stability in a wide temperature range of 25-90 °C, and high tolerance to abuse, such as folding, cutting, or nail penetration.",

A novel chain-end modification of polymer iodides (Polymer-I) via reversible complexation-mediated polymerization (RCMP) with different functionalized radical generation agents, such as azo compounds and organic peroxides, was developed. This reaction was comprehensively studied for three different polymers, i.e., poly (methyl methacrylate), polystyrene and poly (n-butyl acrylate) (PBA), two different functional azo compounds with aliphatic alkyl and carboxy groups, three different functional diacyl peroxides with aliphatic alkyl, aromatic, and carboxy groups, and one peroxydicarbonate with an aliphatic alkyl group. The reaction mechanism was probed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The combination of PBA-I, iodine abstraction catalyst and different functional diacyl peroxides enabled higher chain-end modification to desired moieties from the diacyl peroxide.

Probing their role in the high-strain regime, however, has been difficult because of premature network fracture. Here, we address this problem by using a double-network approach to investigate the high-strain behavior of both randomly and regularly cross-linked networks with the same backbone chemistry. Randomly cross-linked poly(n-butyl acrylate) networks with target molecular weights between cross-links of 5–30 kg/mol were synthesized via free-radical polymerization, while regularly cross-linked poly(n-butyl acrylate) networks with molecular weights between cross-links of 7–38 kg/mol were synthesized via cross-linking of tetrafunctional star polymers. Both types of networks were then swollen in a monomer/cross-linker mixture, polymerized to form double networks, and characterized via uniaxial tensile testing. The onset of strain stiffening was found to occur later in regular networks than in random networks with the same modulus but was well-predicted by the target molecular weight between cross-links of each sample. These results indicate that the low- and high-strain behavior of polymer networks result from different molecular-scale features of the material and suggest that controlling network architecture offers new opportunities to both further fundamental understanding of architecture–property relationships and design materials with independently controlled moduli and strain stiffening responses.",

Therefore, copolymers of N-vinylimidazole (VIm) and butyl acrylate (BuA) were prepared, showing reactivity ratios of rBuA = 1.91–2.02 and rVIm = 0.094–0.10. The prepared copolymers of poly(VIm-co-BuA) with a copolymer composition of 24:76 had sufficiently low Tg (−6.6 °C) and were flexible enough to be used for membrane preparation.

Membranes were prepared using a mixture of 1:8, 1:2 and 1:0 of 1,6-dibromohexane and 1-bromobutane, resulting in different degrees of crosslinking.

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Structural coloration of photonic crystals (PCs) is considered an ecological and environmental way to achieve colorful textiles. However, constructing PCs with obvious structural colors on traditional flexible yarns is still a great challenge. As a secondary structure that forms textiles, compared with fibers and fabrics, the yarns are rougher, hindering the construction of regular PCs. In this work, the flexible acrylic yarns with vivid structural colors, named PC-based structural color yarns, were prepared by constructing regular PCs via assembling poly(styrene-butyl acrylate-methacrylate) (P(St-BA-MAA)) colloidal microspheres on yarns. Specifically, the properties of P(St-BA-MAA) colloidal microspheres were investigated. The PCs with better structural stability and obvious structural colors were prepared by presetting the acrylic adhesive layer on yarns. Moreover, the color durability and color regulation methods of prepared PC-based structural color yarns were evaluated and discussed. The results showed that the P(St-BA-MAA) colloidal microspheres exhibited even particle sizes, excellent monodispersity, and a typical hard core–soft shell structure. And the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the microspheres was tested to be about 65.6 °C. The cationic acrylate regarded as a pretreatment agent could not only improve the combination between the PC layers and the yarns by acting as a “bridge” but also enhance the structural color effect by smoothing the yarn surface. The results showed that when the mass fraction of cationic acrylate was 3 wt %, the microspheres were beneficial to access regular PCs with obvious structural colors.

    "abstract": "Studies on emulsion polymerization (EP) of poly(styrene‐co‐butyl acrylate) [P(S‐co‐BA)] can be accessed in open literature. However, these studies are mostly focusing on lab‐scale polymerization and subsequently characterization, of which discussion on pilot‐scale or mass‐production‐scale of the polymerization is scant. This paper focuses on the batch‐to‐batch reproducibility of P(S‐co‐BA) with 78.7 mol% of styrene and 21.3 mol% of butyl acrylate via EP in 3 metric‐ton (MT) pilot‐scale reactor. Polymerization efficiency, molecular, and physical characterization of the copolymers are examined using gravimetric analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), viscometer, capillary rheometer, particle size analyzer (including dynamic light scattering and laser diffraction techniques), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The gravimetric analysis on the monomer conversion reveals that the polymerization in 3‐MT reactor is efficient with 100% conversion. Besides, 1H‐NMR results reveal that the styrene‐to‐butyl acrylate mole ratio of the copolymer is of close approximation of the monomer feed amount while FTIR is a rather convenient quality control (QC) tool for batch‐to‐batch reproducibility on the copolymer molecular structured. The physical characteristic of [P(S‐co‐BA)] for all five batches are considered reproducible.",

The temperature of 10% of mass loss (T10%) of PLA was around 365 °C, while in the compatibilized PLA/EE blend, this property increased to 370 °C. The PLA average activation energy (Ea¯) reduced in the PLA/EE blend (from 96 kJ/mol to 78 kJ/mol), while the presence of EBAGMA in the PLA/EE blend increased the Ea¯ due to a better blend compatibilization. The solid-state thermal degradation of the PLA and PLA/EE blends was classified as a D-type degradation mechanism. In general, the addition of EE increased the thermodynamic parameters when compared to PLA and the compatibilized blend due to the increase in the collision rate between the components over the thermal decomposition.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The use of catechol-containing comonomers as a general property enhancer to achieve unique properties has received particular attention for designing bioinspired polymeric materials. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to investigate the role of dopamine methacrylamide (DMA) and N-phenethyl methacrylamide (PMA) comonomers in chain conformation and their effects on the mechanical properties and adhesion of poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) copolymer. Addition of 4% by weight of DMA comonomer in the terpolymer structure reduces the gyration radius of the poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) copolymer. This reduction is due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions. A further increase in the DMA up to 12.2% by weight increases the radius of gyration by 5%. The effect of PMA on the gyration radius of the poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) copolymer is more extensive, compared to DMA. While DMA enhances both van der Waals and electrostatic components of the cohesive energy density through increasing π–π interactions and hydrogen bond formations, PMA only improves the van der Waals component. Assessment of mechanical properties revealed that the addition of DMA comonomer resulted in a transition from brittle to tough behavior in poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) pressure-sensitive adhesive. Ductility index improvement by DMA is higher than that by PMA. DMA comonomers accumulate on the silica surface resulting in the terpolymer chains approaching the dry silica surface from the hydroxyl groups of the catechol. Accumulation of DMA only enhances the cohesive energy and does not improve the adhesive energy.",

    "abstract": "Collagen is a suitable material for regenerative medicine because it is characterized by its good biocompatibility. However, due to its fibrillar structure, it cannot organize itself into three-dimensional porous structures without additional modification. The introduction of synthetic monomer elements into the collagen macromolecules is a technique used to form three-dimensional, collagen-based, branched, and crosslinked structures. New types of graft copolymers made from cod collagen with a butyl acrylate and vinyl butyl ether copolymer in aqueous dispersion were obtained in the presence of triethylborane by a radical mechanism. The process of graft copolymer formation proceeded as usual by radical initiation, through radicals formed during triethylborane oxidation by oxygen residues, collagen borination, and reversible inhibition with the participation of a boroxyl radical. The characteristics of the graft copolymers were determined using methods of physical and chemical analysis (GPC, SEM, IR spectroscopy, etc.), while the cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay method. It is shown that the grafting of alternating blocks of butyl acrylate and vinyl butyl ether to the protein macromolecules results in changes in the morphological pattern of the graft co-polymer in comparison with native collagen. This is manifested in the development of consolidations around the collagen fibers of the structural matrices, with the co-polymer cellular structure consisting of interpenetrating pores of unequal size. Additionally, it is important that the graft co-polymer solutions are not toxic at a certain concentration. The above properties confirm the promising nature of the technique’s application as the basis for producing new materials for regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "PA6 is widely used but vulnerable to thermo-oxidative aging, impacting its durability. Hindered phenols are key antioxidants that extend the service life of PA6 by slowing this aging process. However, the effect of molecular structural differences on their antioxidant activity is still elusive, impeding their development and application. Here, two antioxidants, 2-((3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionyl)oxy)ethyl acrylate (PEA) and 2-((3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionyl)oxy)propyl acrylate (PPA), were utilized to enhance the thermo-oxidative aging resistance of PA6. Their primary difference is that PPA possesses an electron-donating group in its molecular structure. The methyl functional group in the PPA molecule can increase the electron cloud density around the benzene ring, resulting in PPA having a higher free radical scavenging rate compared to PEA. In addition, in contrast to PEA, the low volatility and mobility of PPA ensure that its antioxidant activity can be fully utilized during aging. These factors collectively support the excellent antioxidant activity of PPA (PPA > PEA). As a result, the PA6/PPA composite maintains 88% of its original tensile strength after 12 days of continuous aging, whereas PA6/PEA and PA6/1010 (commercial antioxidant) composites retained 70% and methyl 30%, respectively.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe phase segregation as a result of mixing organic semiconductors with polymeric additives has been reported as an intriguing avenue to optimize semiconductor crystal microstructure, active layer composition and charge carrier transport. In this work, we report the mixing of organic semiconductor 6,13‐bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS pentacene) with poly(butylacrylate) as a polymer additive to control the semiconductor crystal growth and morphology. The incorporation of poly(butylacrylate) induces a vertical phase segregation but a more predominant lateral phase segregation with TIPS pentacene. Along with a solvent vapor annealing technique, poly(butylacrylate) evenly distributes the semiconductor nuclei on the polymer matrix, and results in organic crystal with enlarged grain width.

The bottom‐gate, top‐contact thin film transistors with the poly(butylacrylate)/TIPS pentacene mixture as the active layer demonstrated an improved hole mobility of 0.11 cm2/Vs.

    "abstract": "Removable pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are used in the production of self-adhesive materials such as protective films, masking tapes or biomedical electrodes. This work presents a new and environmentally friendly method of obtaining this type of adhesive materials, i.e., photochemically induced free radical telomerization. Adhesive binders to removable PSAs, i.e., the photoreactive acrylic telomer syrups (ATS) were prepared from n-butyl acrylate, acrylic acid, and 4-acrylooxybenzophenone. Tetrabromomethane (CBr4) or bromotrichloromethane (CBrCl3) were used as the telogens. ATS was modified with unsaturated polybutadiene resin and a radical photoinitiator. Adhesive compositions were coated onto a carrier and UV cross-linked. The effects of the chemical nature of telomers (i.e., terminal Br or Cl atoms) and their molecular weight (K-value), as well as the cross-linking degree on adhesive properties of PSAs, were studied. It was found that with the increase in telogen content in the system, the dynamic viscosity of ATS and K-value of acrylic telomers decrease, and the conversion of monomers increases. CBr4 turned out to be a more effective chain transfer agent than CBrCl3. Moreover, telomers with terminal Br-atoms (7.5 mmol of CBr4), due to slightly lower molecular weights and viscosity, showed a higher photocrosslinking ability (which was confirmed by high cohesion results at 20 and 70 °C, i.e., >72 h). Generally, higher values of the temperature at which adhesive failure occurred were noted for PSAs based on ATS with lower telogen content (7.5 mmol), both CBr4 and CBrCl3. The excellent result for removable PSA was obtained in the case of telomer syrup Br-7.5 crosslinked with a 5 J/cm2 dose of UV-radiation (adhesion ca.1.3 N/25 mm, and cohesion > 72 h).",

ACR-SIL dispersions were obtained by emulsion polymerization of mixtures of the same silicone monomers in aqueous dispersions of acrylic/styrene copolymers synthesized from the same mixtures of acrylic and styrene monomers, so the compositions of ACR and SIL parts in corresponding ACR-SIL and SIL-ACR hybrid dispersions were the same. Examination of the properties of hybrid dispersions (particle size, particle structure, minimum film forming temperature, Tg of dispersion solids) as well as of corresponding coatings (contact angle, water resistance, water vapour permeability, impact resistance, elasticity) and films (tensile strength, elongation at break, % swell in toluene), revealed that they depended on the method of dispersion synthesis that led to different dispersion particle structures and on composition of ACR and SIL part.

In addition, the thermal, dynamic viscoelastic, morphological, mechanical and impact strength characteristics of the composite were analyzed. As a result, it was demonstrated that the impact strength was increased up to 2.2 times because PBA acted as a compatibilizer for PLA/PBAT blends and formed the co-continuous morphology.

The polymerization was carried out in solution (n-heptane as the solvent) at 200 and 220 °C without adding any conventional initiators. It was studied with the five different n-BA/n-heptane volume ratios: 50/50, 70/30, 80/20, 90/10, and 100/0. Extensive experimental data presented here show significant monomer conversion at all temperatures and concentrations confirming the occurrence of the thermal self-initiation of the monomer. The order, frequency factor, and activation energy of the thermal self-initiation reaction of n-BA were estimated from n-BA conversion, using a macroscopic mechanistic model. The estimated reaction order agrees well with the order obtained via our quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, the frequency factor and activation energy estimates agree well with the corresponding values that we already reported for bulk polymerization of n-BA.",

Significant findings include the effective control of Mn and low dispersities from the onset of polymerization of St and nBA showing swift addition-fragmentation kinetics, leading to similar behaviors between the two RAFT agents. In contrast, a 4-fold decrease of the chain transfer constant to MMA is established for TTC-bCCH over TTC-bCP. This trend is confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the study compares thermoplastic elastomer properties of all-(meth)acrylic ABA block copolymers produced with both RAFT agents. The impact of dispersity of PMMA blocks on thermomechanical properties evaluated via rheological analysis reveals a more pronounced temperature dependence of the storage modulus (G') for the triblock copolymer synthesized with TTC-bCCH, indicating potential alteration of the phase separation.

A series of PCL-b-PtBA block copolymers synthesized for this study share the same PCL block with molecular weight of Mn = 7.5 kg•mol−1, while the length of PtBA blocks varies. Homogeneous Langmuir monolayers were formed at the A/W interface before reaching the dynamic collapse pressure of PCL blocks. The growth of PCL flat-on crystalline domains predominately took place during the plateau regime after the collapse transition, though nucleation process occurred prior to the collapse transition. The tethered PtBA blocks remain as a monolayer at the A/W interface prior to the second collapse pressure at ∼ 24 mN•m−1, which is comparable to the collapse pressure of PtBA homopolymer monolayer. Depending on the length of PtBA blocks, the block copolymer crystals exhibit morphological features from distorted hexagonal shape, truncated parallelogram, dendrites with defects, stripes, and nano-scale domains, suggesting that the tethered amorphous PtBA block significantly reduced the mobility and packing efficiency of PCL blocks during the crystallization of PCL-b-PtBA copolymers at the A/W interface.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Waterborne latex is often called a product-of-process. Here, the effect of semi-batch monomer feed rate on the kinetics and gel formation in seeded emulsion polymerization was investigated for the copolymerization of n-butyl methacrylate (n-BMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). Strikingly, the gel fraction was observed to be significantly influenced by monomer feed rate, even while most of the experiments were performed under so-called starve-fed conditions. More flooded conditions from faster monomer feed rates, including seeded batch reactions, counterintuitively resulted in significantly higher gel fraction. Chain transfer to polymer was intentionally suppressed here via monomer selection so as to focus mechanistic insights to relate only to the influence of a divinyl monomer, as opposed to being clouded by contributions to topology from long chain branching. Simulations revealed that the dominant influence on this phenomenon was the sensitivity of primary intramolecular cyclization to the instantaneous unreacted monomer concentration, which is directly impacted by monomer feed rate. The rate constant for cyclization for these conditions was determined to be first order and 4000 s−1, approximately 4 times that typically observed for backbiting in acrylates. This concept has been explored previously for bulk and solution polymerizations, but not for emulsified reaction environments and especially for the very low mole fraction divinyl monomer. In addition, while gel fraction could be dramatically manipulated by variations in linear monomer feed rates, it could be markedly enhanced by leveraging non-linear feed profiles built from combination sequences of flooded and starved conditions. For a 2 h total feed time, a fully linear profile resulted in 30% gel while a corresponding non-linear profile with an early fast-feed segment resulted in 80% gel.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Although core-shell microparticles with a hard core and soft shell are often used to fabricate photonic crystal films, they are rarely applied to construct steady amorphous colloidal array (ACA) patterns. In this work, a series of monodisperse core-shell microparticles with a polystyrene (PS) core and poly(methyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate) (P(MMA-BA)) shell have been successfully synthesized, and the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the shell layer have been well regulated. The synthesized core-shell microparticles were then used to fabricate ACA patterns via a convenient infiltration-driven assembly method. The results showed that the Tg of the shell significantly affected the microstructure of the amorphous colloidal arrays (ACAs). During the assembly process, the microparticles quickly contacted each other and the lower-Tg shells could merge with each other to form a continuous film. In this situation, the PS core was embedded and ranked in the P(MMA-BA) film, and both the refractive index contrast and order degree of the colloidal array became relatively low, resulting in a poor structural color. However, when the Tg of the shell layer was moderately high, a short-range ordered array was prepared via infiltration-driven assembly, thereby displaying a bright structural color. More importantly, the shell layers could merge with each other to some extent after short-time heating, resulting in fine mechanical stability. In brief, this study provides a facile and environmental approach to construct steady ACA patterns, which is promising in printing and painting industries.",

For both nanocomposites, in the vicinity of the electrical percolation threshold, i.e. the formation of a continuous filler network, a distinct region is evidence at the transition linear - nonlinear transition in the strain dependent third relative higher harmonics of the shear stress Fourier spectra.

From the variations of these parameters with composition and temperature, the results were discussed from the point of intermolecular interactions prevailing in this system. Also, some theoretical mixing rules (Lorentz-Lorenz, Gladstone-Dale, Arago-Biot, Weiner and Eykman) usually used in correlating the refractive indexes were assessed and results were compared with experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by mussel chemistry, we presented a facile and eco‐friendly method to synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using dopamine as a reductant and stabilizer. The synthesized AgNPs as an antibacterial agent and photothermal filler were further introduced to random copolymers of methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate (MMA‐co‐BA) via latex mixing. The morphology and structure of the formed AgNPs were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–Vis spectrum, and x‐ray powder diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the synthesized AgNPs were spherical in the size of 5–30 nm with the characteristic crystalline structure of AgNPs.

The polymerization of the organic phase produced highly porous polymers called polyHIPE, carrying two functional groups. As a result of the template method, polyHIPEs have a low surface area. To overcome this drawback, polyHIPE was hyper-cross-linked through VBC to create meso- and micropores, resulting in a higher surface area. Then the polymer surface was tailored with carboxylic acid groups by simple hydrolysis of tert-butyl acrylate. The adsorption performances of the acidic functional hyper-cross-linked polyHIPEs prepared for the various reaction times of 0, 15, and 60 min were compared for methylene blue. The hyper-cross-linked polyHIPEs showed an enhanced adsorption kinetics for methylene blue, and the 15 min hyper-cross-linking reaction increased the rate of methylene blue adsorption significantly.

The oil-absorptive capacity of OAP under different solvents was measured as the function of temperature and time. The effect of the OAP on the rheological and filtration properties of OBDFs was initially evaluated, and then the sealing property of OAP particles as lost circulation materials (LCMs) was examined by a high-temperature and high-pressure (HTHP) filtration test, a sand bed filtration test, a permeable plugging test, and a fracture sealing testing. The test results indicated that the addition of OAP had relatively little influence on the rheological properties of OBDF at content lower than 1.5 w/v % but increased the fluid viscosity remarkably at content higher than 3 w/v %. It could reduce the HTHP filtration and improve the sealing capacity of OBDF significantly. In the sealing treatment, after addition into the OBDF, the OAP particles could absorb oil accompanied with volume enlargement, which led to the increase of the fluid viscosity and slowing down of the fluid loss speed. The swelled and deformable OAP particles could be squeezed into the micro-fractures with self-adoption and seal the loss channel. More important, fluid loss was dramatically reduced when OAP particles were combined with other conventional LCMs by a synergistic effect.",

    "abstract": "Although numerous studies have shown the successful use of acrylic-based polymers as one of the chemical substances to improve soil mechanical behavior, their basic ingredients in commercial products are not revealed due to the manufacturers’ confidential policy. Among them, additives including pH control agents, thickeners, antifoams, and wetting agents are widely well-known owing to their enhancement effects on different properties of polymers. However, the effect of additives on the soil–polymer mixture is not completely investigated. Therefore, in this study, some of the frequently used additives in acrylic polymers were selected to investigate the effects of each one on the compressive strength of clayey soil. These additives include xanthan gum, Tylose, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as thickeners, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and Kenon 10 as wetting agents, an ether-based antifoaming agent, and ammonia solution as a pH control agent. A combination of each additive (between 0 and 5% by weight) and polymethyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate (with 5% by weight) was added to kaolinite soil to measure the variation of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and the stress–strain behavior of the soil–polymer–additive mixture. The results indicated that thickeners significantly affected the unconfined compressive strength up to 248% and increased the ductility of the stabilized samples. Acidic pH of the emulsion led to higher unconfined compressive strength of the stabilized soil up to 2.33 times that with alkaline. It is also demonstrated that the use of a higher amount of anionic wetting agent resulted in higher failure strain and lower unconfined compressive strength.",

Hydrogen bonding between the hydrophobic blocks exert significant influence on the morphology of the resulting nanoparticles self-assembled in water. The Janus feature of the GCB moieties makes it possible to use a single polymer type in self-assembly, unlike previous work exploiting, e.g., thymine-containing polymer and adenine-containing polymer.

The presence of side reactions involved in the polymerization mechanisms makes process safety as well as polymer properties more sensitive to operation parameters. In this study, a deterministic moment-based modeling approach combining with the divergence criterion was developed to investigate the non-isothermality of acrylate polymerization process. In silico design of non-adiabatic processes was achieved by the modeling approach involving reaction mechanism, energy balance, and mass balance. The safe and unsafe states of the reactor under a wide range of process operating conditions were identified by a divergence criterion. From the perspective of process intensification, optimization of operating parameters was carried out. Afterwards, the pseudo-isothermal operation was mimicked by using stepwise jacket temperature profiles to investigate the effects of temperature and monomer content on molecular properties. The simulation results provide a safe operating window for the polymerization reactor under the given feed schemes and process conditions. Additionally, a pseudo-isothermal process is more suitable to tune the molecular properties of the resulting polymers during polymerization.

As the chain-growth mechanism, the self-switching between organometallic-mediated radical polymerization (OMRP) and coordination-insertion polymerization (CIP) is suggested.

Structural characterization via NMR, SEC, and FT‐IR confirmed the successful synthesis, while DSC, AFM, and SAXS analyses revealed distinct phase separation in the BCP structures, which results in enhanced mechanical strength and features of thermoplastic elastomers in the materials. Interestingly, the synthesized mechanoresponsive tri‐arm star and bi‐arm linear architectures in both block and random copolymer configurations exhibited a switch‐off state in solution but transitioned to a “switch‐on” state in the film form due to internal strain‐induced mechanophoric activation. Once activated in the film state, the fluorescence intensity increases with increasing stretching, indicating progressive mechanophore activation under mechanical stress, however, with a complete and precise peak shift is only observed for the star BCP architecture. This allows, uniquely in the block copolymers architecture with the mechanophoric unit in the core, a precise determination of additional stress on the material after processing.

For this purpose, a polymeric matrix of acrylonitrile–styrene–butyl acrylate (ASA) is used due to its good mechanical resistance and weather resistance properties. Prior to the manufacturing of the composites, the cork particles are characterized and modified by surface polymerization, creating a layer of poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA). Then, filaments for FDM are prepared by solvent casting and extrusion from ASA and composites with unmodified cork (ASA + C) and PBA-modified cork (ASA + Cm). PBA is one of the polymers present in the structure of ASA, which increases the compatibility between the cork particles and the polymer matrix. This is evidenced by evaluating the mechanical properties of the composites and examining their fracture surface by scanning electron microscopy. The analysis of the thermal properties shows that the developed composites also present enhanced insulating properties.",

Employing solid catalysts and process intensification technologies can overcome these drawbacks. However, the literature is scarce in studies describing the development of complete plants.\n                  Here, the design, control and economic evaluation of a reactive distillation-based process are presented. Since n-butanol is not completely converted in one pass, a decanter–flash system is used to recover and recycle the alcohol, and obtain a high purity waste water stream. To control the purity of the acrylate product when throughput changes or fresh reactants get contaminated, direct control using concentration measurement is required. Indirect control using temperature measurement alone is insufficient; since constant tray temperature cannot hold constant the concentration profile in the column, the acrylate purity always shows an offset. The process robustness is proved by rigorous simulations in Aspen Plus Dynamics.

In this research, phenolic resin (Novolac) and poly (butyl acrylate‐block‐styrene) were used in the formulation of epoxy film adhesive (Diglycidyl ether bisphenol A) to increase thermal stability and adhesion strength and as the toughening agent, respectively. Alumina nanoparticles were also employed to enhance the mechanical properties. The influence of block copolymer and alumina nano particles was also assessed on the mechanical and thermal properties of epoxy‐based film adhesives. The investigation of the mechanical properties of dumbbell‐shaped samples and adhesion strength of the Al‐Al bonded joints were evaluated by tensile, lap shear, and T‐peel tests. The thermal stability of the optimal samples was assessed by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). SEM analysis was also utilized to study the toughening mechanism. Tensile test of the dumbbell‐shaped samples indicated that the incorporation of 2.5 phr block copolymer and 2 phr alumina nanoparticles enhanced the toughness to 250%. The shear and peel strengths of this sample also exhibited 51% and 76% increase, respectively, showing a remarkable synergistic effect. On the other hand, TGA results revealed that the incorporation of block copolymer improved the thermal stability of the adhesive matrix. The copresence of these two materials also showed a considerable synergistic effect on the thermal stability. The SEM results were also in line with the results of mechanical tests as the crack deviation, crack pinning, and debonding were the most important mechanisms of toughening.\nA new platform was developed for designing epoxy films adhesives with high mechanical, adhesion, and thermal properties.\nThe hybrid of butyl acrylate block styrene copolymer, phenolic resin, and alumina nanoparticles showed synergistic effects on the lap shear and T‐peel strength.\nThe greatest improvement in toughness was related to the epoxy adhesive containing 2.5 phr block copolymer and 2 phr alumina nanoparticles.\nAnalysis of the fracture surface showed that by using hybrid of nanoparticles and block copolymers in the epoxy film adhesive formulation, the cohesive failure occurred.\nThe use of hybrid additives in film adhesive formulations enlightened manufacture of adhesives for future studies on adhesive formulations.\n",

This study investigates the solution copolymerization of DBI with both conventional, butyl acrylate (BA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA), and biobased (2-octyl acrylate (2-OA) and isobornyl acrylate (IBOA)) monomers. Using in situ 1H NMR and nonlinear least-squares fitting, reactivity ratios were determined: BA/DBI (r BA = 0.68, r DBI = 0.68), MMA/DBI (r MMA = 3.53, r DBI = 0.38), 2-OA/DBI (r 2‑OA = 1.64, r DBI = 1.44), and IBOA/DBI (r IBOA = 1.87, r DBI = 2.0).

These types of substrates in addition to stabilizing these nanoparticles take advantage of the synergy of properties between both types of materials. The purpose of this research is the in situ synthesis of AgNP in poly (vinyl acetate-co-butyl acrylate-co-neodecanoate) (VAVTD) terpolymer water emulsion as stabilization matrix and the corresponding characterization. UV-VIS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize these AgNP polymer hybrids. Additionally, preliminary work was carried out to assess the biofilm formation of a multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on these AgNP/VAVTD hybrids in order to explore their use in antibacterial applications. The results show that VAVTD terpolymer water emulsion, in low concentrations, is a very good substrate to stabilize AgNP particles as evidenced by the SEM and TEM studies, and the relatively small displacement in the corresponding UV spectra of AgNP particles, even after 45 d of ageing. It was also found a significant reduction of P. aeruginosa cell viability in biofilms formed at 1 and 7 d (p < 0.05) on VAVDT/AgNP hybrid materials, suggesting potential antibacterial properties.

This is particularly challenging when aiming to protect surfaces over a large area to avoid contact mediated infection transmission. Quorum sensing (QS) inhibition has emerged as an alternate antimicrobial approach overcoming evolutionary stress driven resistance observed in antibiotic treatment. However, specific surface orientation requirements and limited work on delivery of small molecule QS inhibiting compounds have limited their widespread applicability certainly when it comes to coating large surfaces. Here, we report antimicrobial nanocomposite coatings overcoming the dependence on molecular orientation of QS inhibiting dihydropyrrol-2-ones (DHP) analogues and release small molecule analogues. In a systematic study, we developed poly(styrene-stat-n-butyl acrylate)/graphene oxide (GO)/DHP analogue nanocomposite antimicrobial coatings that can be easily applied to surfaces of any length scale and studied their efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus. The polymer nanocomposite was designed to undergo coating formation at ambient temperature. The antimicrobial coatings exhibited DHP dose dependent antimicrobial response both in the supernatant growth media with a ∼7-log10 reduction in cell growth and virtually a complete inhibition in cell adhesion on the surface in the best coating compared to controls. When compared, DHP-Br coatings outperformed other DHP analogues (-F and -Ph) both in limiting the cell growth in the media and cellular adhesion on the coating surface. This is the first example of nanocomposite coatings comprising QS inhibiting compounds, and their exceptional performance is expected to pave the way for further research in the field.",

Virtually, no fluidity was observed for the blend containing equimolar amounts of the carboxyl group and the amidine group, which showed a high G′ value of about 1 MPa at −5 °C. For comparison, the supramolecular network polymers crosslinked by ammonium‐carboxylate salt were prepared using a linear polyethyleneimine instead of the polyamidine. The blend with equimolar amounts of the carboxyl group and the secondary amino group showed liquid‐like fluidity with a G′ value of about 0.01 MPa at −5 °C, which was attributed to the fact that a certain amount of the carboxyl group remained as its free form, as evidenced by FTIR analysis. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Suitable crystals for the X‐ray analysis of the complexes 4 and 6 were obtained. It was shown that 6 has a shorter NHC‐palladium bond than the IMes complex 4. The difference of the palladium carbene bond lengths based on the higher π‐acceptor strength of (CN)2IMes in comparison to IMes. Thus, (CN)2IMes should stabilize the catalytically active central palladium atom better than IMes. As a measure for the π‐acceptor strength of (CN)2IMes compared to IMes, the selone (CN)2IMes·Se (7) was prepared and characterized by 77Se‐NMR spectroscopy. The π‐acceptor strength of 7 was illuminated by the shift of its 77Se‐NMR signal. The 77Se‐NMR signal of 7 was shifted to much higher frequencies than the 77Se‐NMR signal of IMes·Se. Catalytic experiments using the Mizoroki‐Heck reaction of aryl chlorides with n‐butyl acrylate showed that 6 is the superior performer in comparison to 4. Using complex 6, an extensive substrate screening of 26 different aryl bromides with n‐butyl acrylate was performed. Complex 6 is a suitable precatalyst for para‐substituted aryl bromides.

In this work, a novel structure was obtained by absorbing reduced graphene oxide on the surfaces of styrene butyl-acrylate copolymer (rGO@SBA) microsphres through soap-free emulsion polymerization technique. Fourier-transform infrared spectrum characterization revealed the successful fabrication of rGO@SBA microspheres. SEM and TEM results indicated that rGO nanosheets were successfully loaded on the surface of SBA microspheres and the average diameter of rGO@SBA was increased to 650 nm. High dielectric permittivity rGO@SBA composites were obtained when the rGO loading was approximated to 2 wt%. The dielectric permittivity of rGO@SBA composites with 2 wt% rGO was 339 times higher than that of neat SBA. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity was also obviously enhanced. However, the dielectric loss of rGO@SBA composites was also inevitably increased. The rGO@SBA microspheres were further melt blended with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix to obtain rGO@SBA/PMMA composites. The glass transition temperature of PMMA was increased with the content of rGO. The dielectric permittivity of rGO@SBA/PMMA composite with only 0.14 wt% rGO was increased to 15.5 at 1 kHz. On the other hand, the dielectric loss was controlled in a low level. SEM observation implied a segregated dispersion of rGO@SBA was realized in PMMA matrix.

Herein, the synthesis of mixed tetraacylgermanes 4 a–c and 6 a–e with a nonsymmetric substitution pattern is presented. Germenolates are crucial intermediates of these new synthetic protocols. The synthesized compounds show increased solubility compared with symmetrically substituted tetraacylgermanes 1 a–d. Moreover, these mixed derivatives reveal broadened n–π* absorption bands, which enhance their photoactivity. Higher absorption of these new compounds at wavelengths above 450 nm causes efficient photobleaching when using an LED emitting at 470 nm. The quantum yields are in the range of 0.15–0.57, depending on the nature of the aroyl substituents. On the basis of these properties, mixed‐functionalized tetraacylgermanes serve as ideal photoinitiators in various applications, especially in those requiring high penetration depth. The synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, NMR and CIDNP spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, photolysis experiments, and X‐ray crystallography. The CIDNP data suggest that the germyl radicals generated from the new tetraacylgermanes preferentially add to the tail of the monomer butyl acrylate.

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "While the improvement of water-based adhesives with renewable additives is important as industry shifts toward more sustainable practices, a complete understanding of how the compatibility between additives and polymers affects adhesive performance is currently lacking. To elucidate these links, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were first functionalized via surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization with the hydrophobic polymers poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to facilitate their incorporation into latex-based pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs). Next, PBA latexes were synthesized using seeded semibatch emulsion polymerization with unmodified or polymer-grafted CNCs added in situ at a loading of 0.5 or 1 phm (parts per hundred parts of monomer). Viscosity and electron microscopy suggested that the polymer-grafted CNCs were incorporated inside or on the latex particles. PSAs containing any CNC type had one or more improved properties (compared to the no-CNC “base case”); CNCs with a low degree of polymerization (DP) grafts exhibited improved tack (up to 2.5-fold higher) and peel strength (up to 6-fold higher) relative to PSAs with unmodified CNCs. The best performing PSA contained the low DP PMMA-grafted CNCs, which is attributed to the higher glass transition temperature and the higher wettability of the PMMA grafts compared to PBA, and the more uniform dispersion of polymer-grafted CNCs throughout the PSA film. In contrast, PSAs containing CNCs with high DP grafts resulted in reduced tack and peel strength (compared to low DP grafts) due to enhanced CNC aggregation. Unfortunately, all PSAs containing polymer-grafted CNCs exhibited inferior shear strength relative to PSAs with unmodified CNCs (and comparable shear strength to the no-CNC “base case”). Collectively, these results provide guidelines for future optimization of more sustainable latex-based PSAs.",

At a low surface pressure, they were miscible, but upon compression, phase separated with a monolayer of the major component block spreading on the water surface, on top of which the minor component block separated out (hierarchical phase separation). The morphology of the minor component block separated out on top of the monolayer varied from a sphere/short string mixture, to long strings, and a mesh-like structure having a regular domain-domain spacing with the increasing content of the minor block, and the hierarchical phase separation was reversible depending on the surface pressure. However, these well-ordered hierarchical phase separations were observed only in the PBA-rich polymers, and a clear morphology was not observed in the PMMA-rich polymers, because of insufficient domain growth after the hierarchical phase separation for the PMMA-rich block copolymers which are more rigid than the PBA-rich polymers.

Guanine‐containing copolymers exhibited superior thermal properties, thermomechanical performance, and more defined morphological structure than cytosine‐containing copolymer analogs due to the relatively strong guanine self‐association, thus expanding the potential applications for mechanically reinforced polymeric networks. Blending guanine‐ and cytosine‐containing copolymers formed a supramolecular structure through multiple hydrogen bonding between guanine and cytosine units.

Nevertheless, after 96 h of incubation, cell viability was below 70 %, which is an indication that the polymer films with 10 and 20 wt.% of CCS were cytotoxic after longer incubation times.

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Rheology modifiers are essential for the flat rheology of water-based drilling fluids in deepwater. The low temperature thickening of deepwater water-based drilling fluids results in dramatic rheological changes in the 20–30 °C range. To address such problems, NIPAM with a self-polymerized product LCST of 32–35 °C was selected as the main body for synthesis. While introducing the hydrophilic monomer AM to enhance the thickening properties, the hydrophobic monomer BA was selected to reduce the LCST of the product. In this paper, a temperature-sensitive polymeric rheology modifier (PNBAM) was synthesized by emulsion polymerization using N-isopropyl acrylamide, acrylamide, and butyl acrylate as monomers. The PNBAM was characterized using infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectroscopy (NMR). The rheological properties, temperature resistance, and salt resistance of PNBAM in the base fluid (BF) were tested. The performance of PNBAM in the drilling fluid system was also evaluated, and a water-based drilling fluid system of flat rheology for deepwater was formulated. The rheological modification mechanism of PNBAM was analyzed by turbidity analysis, particle size analysis, and zeta analysis. Experimental results show that PNBAM has good rheological properties. PNBAM is temperature resistant to 150 °C, salt-resistant to 30 wt%, and calcium resistant to 1.0 wt%. PNBAM also has good flat rheology characteristics in drilling fluid systems: AV4°C:AV25°C = 1.27, PV4°C:PV25°C = 1.19. Mechanistic analysis showed that the LCST (Lower Critical Solution Temperature) of 0.2 wt% PNBAM in an aqueous solution was 31 °C. Through changes in hydrogen bonding forces with water, PNBAM can regulate its hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties before and after LCST, which thus assists BF to achieve a flat rheological effect. In summary, the temperature-sensitive effect of PNBAM has the property of enhancing with increasing temperature. While the tackifying effect of conventional rheology modifiers diminishes with increasing temperature, the temperature-sensitive effect of PNBAM gives it an enhanced thickening effect with increasing temperature, making it a more novel rheology modifier compared to conventional treatment additives.

    "abstract": "This work reveals the influence of pendant hydrogen bonding strength and distribution on self-assembly and the resulting thermomechanical properties of A-AB-A triblock copolymers. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization afforded a library of A-AB-A acrylic triblock copolymers, wherein the A unit contained cytosine acrylate (CyA) or post-functionalized ureido cytosine acrylate (UCyA) and the B unit consisted of n-butyl acrylate (nBA). Differential scanning calorimetry revealed two glass transition temperatures, suggesting microphase-separation in the A-AB-A triblock copolymers. Thermomechanical and morphological analysis revealed the effects of hydrogen bonding distribution and strength on the self-assembly and microphase-separated morphology. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed multiple tan delta (δ) transitions that correlated to chain relaxation and hydrogen bonding dissociation, further confirming the microphase-separated structure. In addition, UCyA triblock copolymers possessed an extended modulus plateau versus temperature compared to the CyA analogs due to the stronger association of quadruple hydrogen bonding. CyA triblock copolymers exhibited a cylindrical microphase-separated morphology according to small-angle X-ray scattering. In contrast, UCyA triblock copolymers lacked long-range ordering due to hydrogen bonding induced phase mixing. The incorporation of UCyA into the soft central block resulted in improved tensile strength, extensibility, and toughness compared to the AB random copolymer and A-B-A triblock copolymer comparisons. This study provides insight into the structure-property relationships of A-AB-A supramolecular triblock copolymers that result from tunable association strengths.",

Significant phase separation was observed after film formation, and the copper phthalocyanine blue (PB) particles tend to distribute in the polysiloxane island phase. After baking at 120 °C, the protrusions were generated. With increasing amount of vinyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (ViPDMS) or baking time, the number of the protrusions became more and the appearance of the protrusions tends to be sharp. When the P(DMS-Acr)/PB CPs were applied in fabric printing, a continuous film was formed on the surface of the fabric at room temperature and therefore the gaps between yarns were blocked. However, the gaps in the fabric reappeared after baking at 120 °C, which could be attributed to the rapid flow of the polymer component. Finally, the fiber was coated with a layer of latex film containing a large number of mastoid structures, and the printed fabric could still retain the majority of the gaps between yarns and between fibers. Therefore, the printed fabric exhibited excellent performances such as good air permeability, softness, and rubbing fastness.",

    "abstract": "19F magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) is an emerging non-invasive imaging modality with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and negligible background interference from biological tissues. However, the hydrophobic nature of fluorine atoms limits both 19F signal intensity and in vivo applicability. Therefore, developing fluorinated MRI contrast agents that combine high fluorine content with good hydrophilicity is essential for advancing in vivo 19F MRI. In this study, a fluorine-containing nanogel (FNG) is synthesized via emulsion polymerization and de-protection using trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFMA) and tert-butyl acrylate (t-BA). The FNG is then loaded with the near-infrared photosensitizer IR780 to obtain a multifunctional imaging probe (IFNG) capable of dual-modal 19F MR and fluorescence (FL) imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). The resulting IFNG exhibited a T2 relaxation time of 46.32 ms, confirming its excellent MRI performance in vitro. In the tumor microenvironment, IFNG undergoes glutathione (GSH)-responsive decrosslinking, which exposes the encapsulated IR780. This process enhances fluorescence signal and promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under near-infrared light, thereby triggering effective PDT. Overall, these findings demonstrate IFNG as a promising nanoplatform that integrates dual-modal 19F MR/FL imaging with GSH-activated photodynamic therapy, offering great potential for precise tumor localization and image-guided cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new class of thermoresponsive colloids that can exhibit a sharp reversible transition between dispersion and aggregation in binary BuAc/EtOH solvents based on the UCST (upper critical solution temperature)-type phase separation. This is realized by grafting linear PMMA-BA (random) copolymer onto the colloidal particles. We have selected TiO2/PS hybrid spheres (HSs) as a model system to demonstrate our general design concept. By grafting the linear PMMA-BA copolymer onto the HS surface, with the molecular weight from 30 to 40 kDa, we found that the thermoresponsive transition between dispersion and aggregation is fast, sharp, and reversible. At high mass fractions of the HSs, we have even observed a sharp transition between dispersion and gelation (or phase separation). The transition temperature can be tuned by varying the binary solvent composition, BuAc/EtOH, and the molecular weight of the grafted linear copolymer in the range from 5 to 55 °C. One of the most important features of this work is that the thermoresponsive materials used in organic solvents are initially synthesized in water with widely applied conventional (instead of research-based) techniques, thus being well suited for industrial production. In addition, the proposed approach is rather general and applicable to realizing the thermoresponsive transition for various types of colloids and nanoparticles.",

Poly(butyl acrylate) was spin-coated onto these films as backing support to make a stable free-standing film of PANi-rGO. The free-standing film was formed upon GO reduction which resulted in simultaneous delamination from the FTO electrode. Compositional and morphological data were obtained via Raman microspectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy and the TE properties were measured in terms of the Seebeck coefficient and conductivities from Hall effect measurements. The Seebeck coefficients of the films measured between 6.6 μV K−1 to 13.4 μV K−1, whereas Hall effect conductivities ranged from 0.483 to 2.68 S cm−1.

    "abstract": "Insect olfactory sensing is crucial for finding food, mating, and oviposition preference. Odorant receptors (ORs) play a central role in the transmission of odorant signals into the environment by the peripheral olfactory system. Therefore, the identification and functional study of ORs are essential to better understand olfactory mechanisms in insects. OR studies on Diptera insects are primarily performed on Drosophila and mosquitoes, but few studies have been reported in Tephritidae. In this study, we examined three candidate ORs (BminOR3, BminOR12, and BminOR16) from Bactrocera minax. Our analysis of tissue expression revealed that the three BminORs were expressed in the antennae, with no difference between the male and female. In in vitro heterologous expression system of Xenopus oocytes. BminOR3/BminOrco responded strongly to 1-octen-3-ol, BminOR12/BminOrco responded to eight compounds [methyl salicylate, benzaldehyde, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, butyl acrylate, butyl propionate, 1-octanol, (S)-(+)-carvone and benzyl alcohol], and BminOR16/BminOrco slightly responded to undecanol. Our results concluded that BminOR3, BimOR12, and BminOR16 could play an important role in host-finding and oviposition positioning in B. minax.",

In this study, enhanced spin capturing polymerizations (ESCPs) of styrene (St) and tert-butyl acrylate (tBA) monomers were, respectively, conducted in the presence of difunctional (1Z,1′Z)-1,1′-(1,4-phenylene) bis (N-tert-butylmethanimine oxide) (PBBN) nitrone. Four-arm (PSt)4 and (PtBA)4 star macroinitiators (MIs) can be afforded. By correspondingly switching the second monomer (i.e., tBA and St), miktoarm star copolymers (μ-stars) of (PSt)2-μ-(PtBA-b-PSt)2 and (PtBA)2-μ-(PSt-b-PtBA)2) were thus obtained. We further conducted hydrolysis of the PtBA segments to PAA (i.e., poly(acrylic acid)) in μ-stars to afford amphiphilic μ-stars of (PSt)2-μ-(PAA-b-PSt)2 and (PAA)2-μ-(PSt-b-PAA)2. We investigated each polymerization step and characterized the obtained two sets of “sequence-isomeric” μ-stars by FT-IR, 1H NMR, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Interestingly, we identified their physical property differences in the case of amphiphilic μ-stars by water contact angle (WCA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. We thus proposed two microstructures caused by the difference of polymer chain sequences. Through this polymerization transformation (Ŧ) approach (i.e., ESCP-Ŧ-NMP), we demonstrated an interesting and facile strategy for the preparations of μ-stars with adjustable/switchable interior and exterior polymer structures toward the preparations of various nanomaterials.",

In the present study, the authors have continued this work by examining the conformational changes that occur during the binding of complement factor 3 (C3) and coagulation factor XII (FXII). Native C3 adsorbed readily to all solid surfaces tested, including a series of acrylate surfaces of varying backbone flexibility. However, a monoclonal antibody recognizing a \"hidden\" epitope of C3 (only exposed during C3 activation or denaturation) bound to the C3 on the rigid acrylate surfaces or on polystyrene (also rigid), but not to C3 on the flexible PLMA, indicating that varying degrees of conformational change had occurred with binding to different surfaces. Similarly, FXII was activated only on the rigid poly(butyl methacrylate) surface, as assessed by the formation of FXIIa-antithrombin (AT) complexes; in contrast, it remained in its native form on the flexible PLMA surface. The authors also found that water wettability hysteresis, defined as the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles, was highest for the PLMA surface, indicating that a dynamic change in the interface polymer structure may help protect the adsorbed protein from conformational changes and denaturation.",

These PyLM belonged to three different families of macromolecules with the first representing short monodisperse linear chains end-labeled with pyrene (polystyrene, poly(ethylene oxide), and poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)), the second representing long polydisperse linear chains randomly labeled with pyrene (poly(methyl acrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, poly(butyl methacrylate), poly(methoxyethyl methacrylate), and poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)), and the third being comprised of two series of pyrene end-labeled low generation dendrimers with a bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid or a polyamidoamine backbone. The assumption, that the polymeric segments probed by an excited pyrenyl label covalently attached to one of these macromolecules obeyed Gaussian statistics, enabled the calculation of their square root average squared end-to-end distance (LPy), which was applied to calculate [Py]loc. The log-log plots of 〈k〉 as a function of [Py]loc yielded straight lines with a slope of unity for all families of macromolecules studied in four different organic solvents demonstrating the validity and generality of the 〈k〉-vs.-[Py]loc relationship. Since an experimentalist knows how the the pyrenyl labels are covalently attached onto a macromolecule, [Py]loc offers a means to probe the local density of a macromolecule, which can be employed to characterize its conformation in solution.

In order to obtain high-quality films in a wide range of temperatures, it is necessary to use special additives - coalescents. It was decided to use methoxypropanol, ethylene glycol and butyl glycol as coalescents. Their main selection criterion was the homogeneity of the resulting film and the absence of external defects. Based on the studies conducted, it was determined that the butyl glycol additive in the composition leads to the reduction in the elastic modulus of film coatings, which, in its turn, invariably leads to the increase in the relative elongation at break.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Statistical copolymers are commercially important because their properties can be tuned by comonomer selection and composition. Rubbery‐state styrene (S)/n‐butyl acrylate (nBA) copolymers have previously been reported to exhibit facile, autonomous self‐healing over a narrow composition band (47/53 to 53/47 mol%). The need for a narrow composition band is explained by alternating comonomer sequences that accommodate interchain secondary bonding. It is hypothesized that copolymers that achieve interchain secondary bonding without alternating sequences can exhibit facile self‐healing over a broad composition range. 2‐ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA) is identified as yielding sequence‐independent secondary bonding interactions. For these interactions it is tested experimentally by glass transition breadth in rubbery‐state S/EHA copolymers, with S/n‐hexyl acrylate (nHA) and S/nBA copolymers as controls. The n‐alkyl acrylate random copolymers exhibit enhanced glass transition breadths over narrow composition bands that correspond to autonomous self‐healing. In contrast, S/EHA copolymers exhibit much greater glass transition breadths than S/nHA and S/nBA copolymers at all compositions tested as well as self‐healing of damage over a broad composition range with full tensile‐property recovery, often in 3–10 h. Characterization of glass transition breadth may serve as a simple screening tool for identifying copolymers that exhibit broad‐composition‐range, facile, autonomous self‐healing and contribute to polymer resilience and sustainability.",

    "abstract": "This scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) deals with the safety re-assessment of (butadiene, styrene, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate) copolymer cross-linked with divinylbenzene or 1,3-butanediol dimethacrylate for use at up to 40% w/w in blends of styrene acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN)/poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Finished articles are intended for repeated contact at room temperature or below with aqueous, acidic and/or low alcoholic foodstuffs for less than 1 day and with dry foodstuffs for more than 1 day. The substance has a low molecular weight fraction (LMWF) below 1,000 Da up to 3.3%. It starts to thermally degrade at ca 230°C, below the maximum temperature of processing finished articles, 250°C. Among the substances released from the heated polymeric additive, four were detected to be released from the finished food contact material (FCM). Migration of oligomers and reaction products into 3% acetic acid and 20% ethanol from a SAN/PMMA material was found to decrease with repeated uses. After the third contact, cyclo-octatetraene, toluene and a hexanedioic acid related substance were detected by GC–MS analysis of the simulant samples, at approximately 5 lg/kg food. From analysis with headspace-GC–MS of heated plastic samples with and without the substance, four volatiles were (semi)quantified at ca 1 lg/6 dm or less. Considering that the substance is a polymeric additive without structural alert for genotoxicity, manufactured using authorised monomers and with limited potential migration of the LMWF, no toxicological data were requested. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for the consumer if it is used at up to 40% w/w in blends of SAN/PMMA repeat-use articles intended for contact at room temperature with aqueous, acidic and/or low alcoholic foodstuffs for less than 1 day and with dry foodstuffs without a time limit. © 2016 European Food Safety Authority.

    "abstract": "A combination of statistical and triblock copolymer properties is explored to produce stable aqueous polymer dispersions suitable for the film formation. In order to perform an extensive structural characterization of the products in the dissolved, dispersed, and solid states, a wide range of symmetrical poly(acrylic acid-stat-styrene)x-block-poly(butyl acrylate)y-block-poly(acrylic acid-stat-styrene)x, poly(AA-st-St)x-b-PBAy-b-poly(AA-st-St)x, (x = 56, 108 and 140, y = 100–750; the AA:St molar ratio is 42:58) triblock copolymers were synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) solution polymerization using a bifunctional symmetrical RAFT agent. It is demonstrated that the amphiphilic statistical outer blocks can provide sufficient stabilization to largely hydrophobic particles in aqueous dispersions. Such a molecular design provides an advantage over copolymers composed only of homoblocks, as a simple variation of the statistical block component ratio provides an efficient way to control the hydrophilicity of the stabilizer block, which ultimately affects the copolymer morphology in solutions and solid films. It was found by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) that the copolymers behaved as dissolved chains in methylethylketone (MEK) but self-assembled in water into stable and well-defined spherical particles that increased in size with the length of the hydrophobic PBA block. These particles possessed an additional particulate surface structure formed by the statistical copolymer stabilizer block, which self-folded through the hydrophobic interactions between the styrene units. SAXS and atomic force microscopy showed that the copolymer films cast from the MEK solutions formed structures predicted by self-consistent field theory for symmetrical triblock copolymers, while the aqueous dispersions formed structural morphologies similar to a close-packed spheres, as would be expected for copolymer particles trapped kinetically due to the restricted movement of the blocks in the initial aqueous dispersion. A strong correlation between the structural morphology and mechanical properties of the films was observed. It was found that the properties of the solvent cast films were highly dependent on the ratios of the hard [poly(AA-st-St)] and soft (PBA) blocks, while the aqueous cast films did not show such a dependence. The continuous phase of hard blocks, always formed in the case of the aqueous cast films, produced films with a higher elastic modulus and a lower extension-to-break in a comparison with the solvent-cast films.",

Synthesis of structurally diverse poly(β-peptoid)s is highly desirable yet challenging. Herein, we report a new approach to synthesize skeletal chiral β-peptoid polymers from readily available aspartic acid derivatives. Two types of N-substituted β3-homoalanine monomers, i.e., N-(methyl propionate)-Asp-OMe (NMeP-Asp-OMe) and N-(tert-butyl propionate)-Asp-OMe (NtBuP-Asp-OMe), were synthesized in high yield via an aza-Michael addition reaction between l-aspartic acid-1-methyl ester (l-Asp-OMe) and acrylate species. Both N-substituted β3-homoalanines can be readily converted into polymerizable N-substituted β3-homoalanine N-carboxyanhydrides (β-NNCAs). Subsequent ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of these β-NNCA monomers provides access to oligo(β-peptoid)s and mPEG-poly(β-peptoid) diblocks with backbone chirality. Their conformations were preliminarily studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectra and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).

A complex initiation system was used to enhance the grafting efficiency. The mechanisms of initiation and graft copolymerization were discussed.

The results showed that the folding resistance and picking resistance were improved. All the other properties were at least equally good as in the reference sample.

The water-written textiles exhibited structural color changes in 0.6 s via an increase in the refractive index, driven by water penetrating the gaps between H-SiO2 microspheres. The structural color was restored to the initial state after the water evaporated, allowing multiple cycles of the write-erase-write mode. The hydrophobic P(TFEMA-BA) adhesive was used to construct a stable chromogenic array and endow WRSC textiles with antispreading properties, thereby improving structural stability and achieving clear writing patterns.

    "abstract": "Diblock oligomeric peptide-polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) are biohybrid materials that offer versatile functionality by integrating the sequence-dependent properties of peptides with the synthetic versatility of polymers. Despite their potential as biocompatible materials, the rational design of PPAs for assembly into multichain nanoparticles remains challenging due to the complex intra- and intermolecular interactions emanating from the polymer and peptide segments. To systematically explore the impact of monomer composition on nanoparticle assembly, PPAs were synthesized with a random coil peptide (XTEN2) and oligomeric alkyl acrylates with different side chains: ethyl, tert-butyl, n-butyl, and cyclohexyl. Experimental characterization using electron and atomic force microscopies demonstrated that the tail hydrophobicity impacted accessible morphologies. Moreover, the characterization of different assembly protocols (i.e., bath sonication and thermal annealing) revealed that certain tail compositions provide access to kinetically trapped assemblies. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of micelle formation unveiled key interactions and differences in core hydration, dictating the PPA assembly behavior. These findings highlight the complexity of PPA assembly dynamics and serve as valuable benchmarks to guide the design of PPAs for a variety of applications, including catalysis, mineralization, targeted sequestration, antimicrobial activity, and cargo transportation.",

    "abstract": "Natural systems, such as tendons and spider silk, demonstrate how the combination of strength and stretchability can be effectively achieved by integrating stiff and flexible network structures. Inspired by these systems, we developed a novel, solvent-free dual-network adhesive based on a self-assembling ABA triblock copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(n-butyl acrylate)-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA), designed for applications requiring both high strength and stretchability. The triblock copolymer forms a physically crosslinked network through microdomains of PMMA end-blocks that provide structural integrity, while the PnBA mid-block forms a soft, stretchable matrix. To further enhance mechanical performance, a second poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) network is polymerized in situ, locking the PMMA microdomains in place and creating a load-bearing system. By varying the crosslinking density of the secondary network, we tailor the adhesive's mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 0.17 - 1.18 MPa) to suit different substrates, creating a mechanically transparent seam. The resulting dual-network system combines different strategies to achieve high strength and stretchability, with adhesive performance comparable to industrial methods such as sewing, particularly in bonding neoprene fabric composites and sealing the joints. Our solvent-free approach also eliminates the need for lengthy solvent evaporation steps, offering an eco-friendly and more efficient alternative for flexible adhesive applications in fields such as soft robotics, flexible electronics, and sports apparel.",

Herein, hydrophobic butyl acrylate with CO and CC groups is reported as a new additive to enhance the PCE and moisture/thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3‐based PSCs, which improves the quality of the perovskite film by promoting defect passivation, constructing a suitable energy‐level alignment, and increasing the charge carrier lifetime in PSCs. Such an additive is easily introduced into PSCs without the need for thermal treatment, which is typically required by other additives, causing a negative effect on the efficiency. The CH3NH3PbI3‐based PSC with butyl acrylate additive shows a superior PCE of 20.0%, 19% higher than that of the unmodified device (16.8%), as well as much improved moisture/thermal stability.

Butyl acrylate (BA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) were used as the main monomers and hexafluorobutyl methacrylate (HFMA, C8H8F6O2), and benzyl methacrylate (BZMA, C11H12O2) were used as functional monomers. Factors such as the amount of initiator, mass ratio of SDBD to OP‐10 and monomers, which have an influence on particle size and morphology of the resultant colloid, are studied. Chemical composition of the modified acrylate colloid was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The thermal performances were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG). Furthermore, surface hydrophobicity of the latex film was examined by measurement of water absorption and water contact angle. Results indicate that the modified acrylate colloid has highest monomer conversion rate and lowest coagulation percentage when the mass fraction of emulsifier was 4% and mass ratio of SDBS to OP‐10 was 1:2, mass fraction of initiator was 0.3%, mass percent of HFMA was 6%, and the amount of BZMA was 2%. Benzene ring‐containing monomer is effectively participated in the reaction and has improved the thermal performance and surface properties of copolymer colloid. The resultant colloid has excellent hydrophobicity and low surface energy. Solid content of the resultant colloid was about 30% (wt %).",

    "abstract": "The results of systematic studies on the surface energy γ and its polar γP and dispersion γD components of statistical copolymers of styrene and butadiene, acrylonitrile and butadiene, and butyl acrylate and vinyl acetate, with regard to their thermal prehistory, are generalized. Along with copolymers, the surfaces of their composing homopolymers were examined. We obtained the energy characteristics of the adhesive surfaces of copolymers that contacted with air, high-energy aluminium Al (γ = 160 mJ/m2), and the low-energy substrate surface of polytetrafluoroethylene F4 (PTFE) (γ = 18 mJ/m2). The surfaces of copolymers in contact with air, aluminium, and PTFE were investigated for the first time. It was found that the surface energy of these copolymers tended to occupy an intermediate value between the surface energy of the homopolymers. The additive nature of the change in the surface energy of the copolymers with their composition, as previously established in the works of Wu, extends to the dispersive component of the free surface energy γD and the critical surface energy γcr, according to Zisman. It was shown that a significant influence on the adhesive activity of copolymers was exerted by the substrate surface upon which the adhesive was formed. Thus, for the butadiene–nitrile copolymer (BNC) samples formed in contact with a high-energy substrate, their surface energy growth was associated with a significant increase in the polar component of the surface energy γP from 2 mJ/m2 for the samples formed in contact with air, to an increase from 10 to 11 mJ/m2 for the samples formed in contact with Al. The reason why the interface influenced the change in the energy characteristics of the adhesives was the selective interaction of each macromolecule fragment with the active centres of the substrate surface. As a result, the composition of the boundary layer changed and it became enriched with one of the components. The structure of such layers is nonequilibrium. The thermal annealing of copolymers in the mode of a stepwise temperature increase led to a convergence in the values of γ, asymptotically tending to the value characteristic of the surface of the copolymers formed in air. The activation energies for the processes of the conformational rearrangements of the macromolecules in the surface layers of the copolymers were calculated. It was found that the conformational rearrangements of the macromolecules in the surface layers occurred as a result of the internal rotation of the functional groups that determined the polar component of the surface energy.",

Notably, they can shift color in response to external force, enabling real‐time visual monitoring of localized strain/stress changes. As a proof of concept, the structurally‐colored adhesive can be used to seal a leaking hole on a bottle or tube, and it can precisely visualize the localized pressure distribution, providing critical information on the adhesion performance and the local pressure.

    "abstract": "Blended films comprising poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA)-grafted cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), exhibited more intense photoluminescence (PL) and longer PL emission lifetimes compared to pristine P3HT films. Optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra indicated reduced torsional disorder i.e. enhanced backbone planarity in the P3HT@CNC blended composites compared to the bare P3HT. Such molecule-level geometrical modification resulted in both smaller interchain and higher intrachain exciton bandwidth in the blended composites compared to the bare P3HT, because of reduced interchain interactions and enhanced intrachain order. These results indicate a potential switch of the aggregation behavior from dominant H-aggregates to J-aggregates, supported by Raman spectroscopy. The reorganization of micromolecular structure and concomitant macroscopic aggregation of the conjugated polymer chains resulted in a longer conjugation length for the P3HT@CNC blended composites compared to the bare P3HT. Additionally, this nanoscale morphological change produced a reduction in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap of the blends, evidenced from optical absorption spectra. Classical molecular dynamics simulation studies predicted the probability of enhanced planarity in the polymer backbone following interactions with CNC surfaces. Theoretical results from density functional theory calculations corroborate the experimentally observed reduction of optical bandgap in the blends compared to bare P3HT. The blended composite outperformed the bare P3HT in nitro-group PL sensing tests with a pronounced difference in the reaction kinetics. While the PL quenching dynamics for bare P3HT followed Stern–Volmer kinetics, the P3HT@CNC blended composite exhibited a drastic deviation from the same. This work shows the potential of a functionalized rod-like biopolymer in tuning the optoelectronic properties of a technologically important polymeric organic semiconductor through control of the nanoscale morphology.",

Morphological studies suggested that a mesogenic phase was immediately formed in the polymer even if polymerization in thin films occurred above the nematic-to-isotropic (N→I) transition temperature of the monomer (Tn-i = 45.8 °C). Dynamic mechanical analysis of 2 × 2 mm cross-section bar samples polymerized at 60 °C showed reduced elastic moduli, increased glass transition temperature and formation of a more crosslinked network, in comparison to polymers formed at lower polymerization temperatures. Fractography analysis showed that polymers generated from the nematic liquid crystalline phase underwent a different fracture pattern in comparison to those generated from the isotropic phase. Volumetric shrinkage (2.2%) found in polymer polymerized from the nematic liquid crystalline phase at room temperature was substantially less than the 6.0% observed in polymer polymerized from an initial isotropic phase at 60 °C, indicating that an organized monomer can greatly contribute to reducing cure shrinkage.",

The performance of PMEA has been attributed to the existence of cold-crystallizable water in it, as observed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). However, little is known on the property of the water in PMEA above 0 °C, especially at ambient temperature including the body temperature, because blood compatibility is observed at 37 °C. The present study was performed to clarify the state of water in PMEA in the temperature range 15–45 °C using solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). In addition, water in poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA), which exhibited poor blood compatibility, was used as a control. In the NMR spectra of water in PMEA, two peaks appeared at 4.87 ppm and 3.71 ppm at 30 °C, showing the existence of two types of water structures. The peak intensity of the upfield water was considerably higher than that of the downfield water. On the other hand, the hydrated PBA showed only one peak at 4.98 ppm at 30 °C. The dynamic property of water in these polymers was estimated from the deuterium solution NMR spin-lattice relaxation time, T12H. The T12H values of peaks observed at 4–5 ppm were relatively high, denoting rapid motion, while those of water at 3.7 ppm in PMEA were small, denoting slow mobility. Thus, the states of water molecules in PMEA in terms of chemical shift and mobility were considered different from those in PBA at ambient temperature.",

The Mn (II) complexes were characterized by FTIR, UV–Vis, elemental analysis, molar conductivity, cyclic voltammetry, MALDI‐TOF mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance, and rationalized with density functional theory (DFT) studies. All complexes were evaluated as photo‐OMRP mediators under LED irradiation at 390 nm and in the 400–800 nm range.

    "abstract": "The kinetics of radical polymerization of butyl acrylate initiated by potassium peroxydisulphate and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as phase transfer catalyst (PTC) was carried out under inert and unstirred conditions at constant temperature of 60 ± 2 °C in ethyl acetate–water biphase media. The polymerization reactions were relatively fast in the two-phase systems with phase transfer agent whereas extremely sluggish in the system without PTC. Use of PTC accelerates the reaction effectively if the reactants located in two phase. The effects of rate of polymerization (Rp) on various experimental conditions such as different concentrations of monomer, initiator, phase transfer catalyst, temperature, and different ionic strength of the medium were explored. The order with respect to monomer, initiator and phase transfer catalyst was found to be unity. The Rp is independent of ionic strength and pH of the medium. However, an increase in the polarity of solvent has slightly increased the Rp value. Based on the results obtained, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for the polymerization reaction. The obtained polymer was confirmed by FT-IR analysis.",

By precisely adjusting the ratio of methyl methacrylate to butyl acrylate and integrating methacrylic acid and N,N‐dimethylethanolamine to enhance hydration stability, the resin achieves optimal hardness, flexibility, and adhesion. The incorporation of 10% acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate dramatically enhances water resistance, extending beyond 10 days, while improving thermal durability and barrier performance, as confirmed by thermogravimetric and electrochemical analyses. Remarkably, the varnish achieved a high crosslinking density at just 110°C, resulting in a durable coating with 2H hardness.

    "doi": "10.14529/chem210206",
    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The synthesis of a copolymer of butyl acrylate with vinyl butyl ether was carried out by a compensatory method in boiling vinyl butyl ether, at its excess, in the presence of triethyl boron isolated from the complex with hexamethylenediamine and an oxidizing agent. The resulting copolymer was used as a macroinitiator by adding a new portion of butyl acrylate to boiling vinyl butyl ether. Several samples of macroinitiators were obtained with different copolymerization times. As the formation of macromolecules upon copolymerization of butyl acrylate with vinyl butyl ether occurs along two centers of chain growth: oligomeric, formed due to the capture of initiating and growing radicals with a small number of copolymer units by boroxyl radicals, and one with low molecular weight, formed by conventional radical chain termination during initiation by alkyl and alkoxyl radicals, the composition of the isolated copolymer contains an oligomer and a low molecular weight copolymer. In the oligomeric fraction of the copolymer, there are more labile bonds with the boroxyl radical at the end of the chain than in the low molecular weight copolymer; as a result, the addition of butyl acrylate to the solution in vinyl butyl ether of the copolymer isolated from the reaction mixture leads to the formation of a block copolymer with a higher molecular weight, while the molecular weight increases after this, due to the addition of new copolymer units most of all to the oligomeric part of the sample. An increase in the molecular weight of the copolymer due to the grafting of new units predominantly onto the oligomer via a labile bond according to the reversible inhibition scheme leads to an increase in the mass of the samples and noticeable changes in the molecular weight distribution curve. If the sample synthesis time significantly exceeds the dosing time, the revealed effects are weaker, which is associated with the recombination of radicals formed according to the scheme of reversible inhibition, due to the usual radical termination. The presented data indicate that the copolymer of butyl acrylate with vinyl butyl ether synthesized in the presence of triethyl boron and an oxidizing agent during compensatory copolymerization in an excess of vinyl butyl ether is a macroinitiator of the block copolymerization of butyl acrylate with vinyl butyl ether, due to the labile bond of the terminal boroxyl radical.",

A new method of EARs preparation, i.e., the free radical bulk photopolymerization process (FRBP), was studied in detail. The influence of methacrylic monomers (methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, (2-acetoacetoxy)ethyl methacrylate) and vinyl monomers (N-vinylpyrrolidone and styrene) on the FRBP process of base monomers (i.e., butyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) was investigated. The kinetics of photopolymerization process was monitored by photo-differential scanning calorimetry method. The properties of the obtained EARs (viscosity and average molecular weights), as well as monomers conversion using 1H NMR, were determined. It was revealed that styrene significantly decreases the photopolymerization rate and increases the final monomers conversion (+27%). However, the resulting tetrapolymers BA-co-GMA-co-HEA-co-STY have low molecular weights and low polydispersity (2.2). Methacrylate monomers with shorter aliphatic chains (<C4) also decrease the rate of photopolymerization due to the length of the aliphatic chain increasing. Surprisingly, the best results of adhesion to steel and shear strength were obtained for SAT based on epoxy acrylate resin with styrene (11 N/25 mm and 20.8 MPa, respectively). However, the thermomechanical properties of SAT with styrene were weaker than those with methacrylates.",

To address this issue, a new supramolecular regulation strategy was developed, which could precisely control the preparation of pillar[n]arene-based SPN materials with excellent mechanical properties by adjusting the polymer network structures. Specifically, we utilized the host-guest interaction between pillar[5]arene and the alkyl chain of butyl acrylate monomer to form a supramolecular polymer network and achieved the transformation of different states by regulating the cross-linking density of the polymer networks.

Interfacial energy measurements predicted that the EBA‐GMA would localize at the interface of components in PLA/PA11 samples. Morphological investigations demonstrated a combination of complete wetting and partial wetting phase structure for PLA/PA11/EBA‐GMA (70/30‐x/x) systems containing 30 wt% modifier phases. When presented at 10–15 wt%, EBA‐GMA formed an interfacial layer around the minor PA11 phase domains and produced a fine dispersion of PA11 in the PLA. Increasing EBA‐GMA to 20 wt% led to a reduction in the degree of encapsulation of PA11 by EBA‐GMA, and a coarser dispersion of EBA‐GMA was also observed in the resulting ternary blend. Compatibility between the components of the PLA/PA11/EBA‐GMA ternary samples was investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The maximum impact toughness was achieved for PLA/PA11/EBA‐GMA (70/15/15) blend, which exhibited the excellent dispersion state of both PA11 and EBA‐GMA phases in the PLA. Impact fractography revealed the generation of multiple voids and cavities either around the PA11 or inside the EBA‐GMA phase regions during the fracture process. The generation of such micro‐voids followed by their plastic growth during crack propagation activated plastic deformation of the PLA, serving as the primary source in the dissipation of impact fracture energy.",

Here, we evaluate the electrochemical properties of a LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC111) powder electrode formed using a waterborne-styrene-acrylic-rubber (SAR) latex binder combined with sodium carboxymethylcellulose. The composite electrodes prepared with the SAR-based binder copolymerized with the butyl acrylate monomer and styrene exhibited high adhesive strength and excellent cyclability and rate capability. The results of surface analysis via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggested that the electrode with the SAR-based binder is more resistant to electrolyte decomposition during charge and discharge cycling compared with the NMC111 electrode comprising the conventional PVdF binder. The SAR-derived passivation resulted in enhanced capacity retention during long-term cycling tests of both half- and full-cells (NMC111//graphite). An electrode with a higher Ni content, LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622), fabricated using the SAR-based binder, retained 87.1% of its capacity after 50 cycles at 4.6 V and exhibited excellent cycling stability.",

The investigated crosslinker‐free formulations are composed of n‐butyl acrylate monomer and a UV photo‐initiator mixed with poly(methyl methacrylate)‐b‐poly(n‐butyl acrylate)‐poly(methyl methacrylate) ABA triblock copolymers. Two different pre‐synthesized copolymers are used to control the macrophase separation. One synthesized by nitroxide‐mediated radical polymerization (NMRP), and a second by anionic polymerization (AP). Essentially, NMRP route leads to copolymer with unsaturated chain ends, activated during UV photopolymerization. On the other hand, the copolymer synthesized by AP are chemically inert. That dissimilarity is also highlighted by time‐resolved FTIR and SAXS, performed to monitor respectively monomer conversion and nanostructure evolution during photopolymerization. The experimental data demonstrate that the reactivity of the triblock copolymer impacts drastically the polymerization kinetics and the self‐assembly processes. Finally, the rheological analysis shows that the produced materials present a solid‐like behavior at low frequencies despite a large PnBA content (i.e., 85 wt%). This property is associated to the phase segregation and to the sample hierarchical morphology.",

In this study, we applied the error-in-variables model (EVM) to estimate reactivity ratios. The ternary reactivity ratios were found to be r12 = 0.417, r21 = 0.071, r13 = 4.459, r31 = 0.198, r23 = 0.260, and r32 = 55.339 (BA/MDO/VAc 1/2/3), contrasting with their binary counterparts, which are significantly different, indicating the critical need for ternary system analysis to accurately model multicomponent polymerization systems. Through the application of a recast Alfrey–Goldfinger model, this investigation predicts the terpolymer’s instantaneous and cumulative compositions at various conversion levels, based on the ternary reactivity ratios. These predictions not only provide crucial insights into the incorporation of MDO across different initial feed compositions but also offer estimates of the final terpolymer compositions and distributions, underscoring their potential in designing compostable or degradable polymers.",

Within seconds, an ethyl acrylate tank exploded and was followed a few minutes later by a butyl acrylate tank explosion. The explosions and ensuing fire led to a lengthy shutdown; fortunately, there were no injuries. This article details the investigation into the complex sequence of events that led to the two explosions. The tank installations complied with the industry lightning standards, but if the tanks met industry standards, why did the explosion happen? While the exact mechanism could not be determined with certainty, the ignition of the atmosphere in the ethyl acrylate tank most likely occurred from a spark discharge inside the tank's headspace, likely between internal components at different electrical voltage potentials. This type of mechanism could invalidate the Faraday Cage assumption inherent in current industry guidance and may represent a hazard that is not currently well‐recognized. It should also be noted that, while lightning cannot be prevented, the outcome of a lightning strike can be mitigated by the use of safeguards such as inertion, flame arresters, diking, and foam systems.",

The reference electrode was a potassium ion sensor, which acts as a pseudo-reference. Both electrodes were made from Ag/AgCl screen-print electrodes fabricated from a non-plasticized and photocurable poly(n-butyl acrylate) membrane that contained various other membrane components. The pseudo-reference potential based on the potassium ion sensor was fixed in 0.050 M KNO3, and such concentration of K+ ion did not interfere with the measurement of the Al3+ ion using the aluminium sensor. With such a pseudo-reference and in the presence of 0.050 M KNO3 as a background medium, the aluminium sensor measured changes of aluminium ion concentrations linearly from 10−6 to 10−2 M Al3+ ion with a Nernstian response of 17.70 ± 0.13 mV/decade. A low detection limit of 2.45 × 10−7 M was achieved with this all-solid-state potentiometric system. The aluminium sensor was insensitive to pH effects from 2.0 to 8.0 with a response time of less than 50 s. Under optimum conditions, a lifetime of 49 days was achieved with good sensor selectivity, reversibility, repeatability, and reproducibility. The all-solid-state electrode system was applied to analyze the Al3+ ion content of water samples from a water treatment plant. Compared with the conventional potentiometric detection system for aluminium ions, the new all-solid-state aluminium ion sensor incorporating a pseudo-reference from the potassium sensor demonstrated similar analytical performance.

The presence of the MWCNTs had no significant effect on the polymerization kinetics, but strongly affected the polymer characteristics (Tg and insoluble polymer fraction). The performance of the in situ composites was compared with that of the neat polymer dispersion as well as with those of the polymer/MWCNT physical blends. The in situ composites showed the presence of an additional phase likely due to the strong interaction between the polymer and MWNCTs (including grafting) that reduced the mobility of the polymer chains. As a result, a substantial increase of both the storage and the loss moduli was achieved. At 60 °C, which is above the main transition region of the polymer, the in situ composites maintained the reinforcement, whereas the blends behaved as a liquid-like material.

The extent of dynamic and chemical crosslinking was related to the mechanical and thermal properties of the materials. Furthermore, the dependence of the material properties on different dynamic crosslinkers—tributyl-(4-vinylbenzyl)ammonium sulfopropyl acrylate (C4ASA) and trihexyl-(4-vinylbenzyl)ammonium sulfopropyl acrylate (C6ASA)—was studied. The materials’ mechanical and thermal properties were characterized by means of tensile tests, dynamic mechanical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. The dynamic crosslinks strengthened the materials considerably. Chemical crosslinks decreased the elasticity of the materials but did not significantly affect their strength. Comparison of the two ionic crosslinkers revealed that changing the crosslinker from C4ASA to C6ASA results in more elastic, but slightly weaker materials.

The effect of core–shell nanoparticles on the tensile, flexural and Charpy impact properties of PLA nanocomposite were experimentally investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were performed to investigate the toughening mechanisms of nanocomposites. The experimental results showed that the addition of core–shell nanoparticles can improve the stiffness and strength of PLA. Meanwhile, its elongation at break, tensile toughness and impact resistance were enhanced simultaneously. These observations can be attributed to the cavitation of the flexible shell in core–shell nanoparticles and the resultant shear yielding of the matrix.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Nucleic acid-based medicines and vaccines are becoming an important part of our therapeutic toolbox. One key genetic medicine is antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which are short single-stranded nucleic acids that downregulate protein production by binding to mRNA. However, ASOs cannot enter the cell without a delivery vehicle. Diblock polymers containing cationic and hydrophobic blocks self-assemble into micelles that have shown improved delivery compared to linear nonmicelle variants. Yet synthetic and characterization bottlenecks have hindered rapid screening and optimization. In this study, we aim to develop a method to increase throughput and discovery of new micelle systems by mixing diblock polymers together to rapidly form new micelle formulations. We synthesized diblocks containing an n-butyl acrylate block chain extended with cationic moieties amino ethyl acrylamide (A), dimethyl amino ethyl acrylamide (D), or morpholino ethyl acrylamide (M). These diblocks were then self-assembled into homomicelles (A100, D100, and M100)), mixed micelles comprising 2 homomicelles (MixR%+R'%), and blended diblock micelles comprising 2 diblocks blended into one micelle (BldR%R'%) and tested for ASO delivery. Interestingly, we observed that mixing or blending M with A (BldA50M50 and MixA50+M50) did not improve transfection efficiency compared to A100; however, when M was mixed with D, there was a significant increase in transfection efficacy for the mixed micelle MixD50+M50 compared to D100. We further examined mixed and blended D systems at different ratios. We observed a large increase in transfection and minimal change in toxicity when M was mixed with D at a low percentage of D incorporation in mixed diblock micelles (i.e., BldD20M80) compared to D100 and MixD20+M80. To understand the cellular mechanisms that may result in these differences, we added proton pump inhibitor Bafilomycin-A1 (Baf-A1) to the transfection experiments. Formulations that contain D decreased in performance in the presence of Baf-A1, indicating that micelles with D rely on the proton sponge effect for endosomal escape more than micelles with A. This result supports our conclusion that M is able to modulate transfection of D, but not with A. This research shows that polymer blending in a manner similar to that of lipids can significantly boost transfection efficiency and is a facile way to increase throughput of testing, optimization, and successful formulation identification for polymeric nucleic acid delivery systems.",

It was found that only in those polymerizations in which these precursors were sufficiently quickly converted into amphiphilic molecules, via a type of polymerization induced self-assembly (PISA) mechanism, stable emulsion polymerization could be carried out. This process was too slow in the emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and in order to obtain stable latexes, the addition of a conventional surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate, SDS) was necessary. In the emulsion polymerization of butyl acrylate, however, reactions with the macromonomers were faster and because of the more hydrophobic nature of BA (as compared to MMA), stabilizers were sufficiently quickly formed in situ and stable latexes were produced without the need for additional SDS. Also the emulsion polymerization of butyl methacrylate (BMA), which reacts via the same “sulfur-free RAFT” mechanism as MMA, could be carried out in the absence of SDS because of the greater hydrophobicity of the monomer. Copolymerizations of MMA with >30% of BA or 85% BMA also resulted in stable latexes without the addition of SDS. The synthesized macromonomers and in situ formed copolymers were characterized by means of size exclusion chromatography (SEC), 1H NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-ToF MS.",

Gp and Gp,GMA were lower for TRGO-polymer with a higher nominal Mn for the grafted polymer chain, which was ascribed to the more noticeable shielding effect for a longer grafted polymer chain on TGRO during synthesis. The number of stacked layers (N) from XRD measurements was 143.2, 14.3, and 6.9 for graphite, GO, and TRGO, respectively. For polymer-grafted TRGO, N decreased to 3.8–6.9. Either increasing Mn or increasing GMA composition in the exterior grafted polymer on TRGO led to a smaller N.

This molecular design enhances mechanical robustness and enables strain‐dependent viscoelastic behavior, transitioning from a rigid state at low strain rate to a soft, dissipative state at high strain. Rheological studies confirm a high storage modulus (G′) and a tunable damping factor (tanδ = 1.06–1.35), ensuring efficient shock absorption and energy dissipation. Thermal analysis reveals excellent thermal stability, with degradation onset at ≈280 °C, making PE40 suitable for high‐temperature applications. Additionally, self‐healing properties enable mechanical integrity recovery post‐damage, while strong adhesive interactions enhance interfacial bonding, broadening its application scope. The cation‐π interaction of PE40 enables significant toughness, durability, and adaptability, making it a promising candidate for protective coatings, structural reinforcements, and energy‐damping applications.

This reaction predominantly affected her cheeks, with the left more so than the right, extending to just below her eye. She also had mild eye swelling. The description and photographs taken at the time were atypical for a hair dye reaction, and on further questioning she revealed she had been sat in close proximity to someone undergoing acrylic nail treatment during the aforementioned hair appointment. We undertook patch testing to our baseline, anti-infective, excipient, hairdressing, fragrance, acrylic nail, cosmetic, photopatch and perianal series. Positive results were observed for 14 acrylates found in acrylic nails, namely methyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, urethane dimethacrylate, bisphenol A dimethacrylate 2%, bisphenol A glycidyl dimethacrylate 2%, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, and triethylene glycol diacrylate. No reactions were observed to any hair dyes on patch testing. Skin prick testing for para-phenylenediamine (PPD) was also negative, excluding a type 1 allergy to PPD. She reported prior but infrequent use of acrylic nails, the last instance being over a year ago. It is therefore likely that the patient became sensitized through these exposures, leading to a pronounced reaction following subsequent airborne exposure to acrylates. An increasing incidence of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to acrylates has been noted, particularly among nail technicians and consumers. Although airborne contact dermatitis to acrylates is rare, it has been reported in occupational settings involving nail technicians and dental nurses, and in manufacturing. Facial dermatitis or dermatitis in exposed areas without direct allergen contact has been documented. Additionally, four cases of respiratory sensitization with acrylate-induced occupational asthma have been reported in conjunction with ACD. Respiratory problems were often alleviated with mask usage, but airborne contact dermatitis posed greater challenges, prompting job changes. Efforts to collect sensitizers using air pumps for vapours and filters for airborne aerosols have seen limited success. This unusual case underscores the diverse clinical presentations of acrylate sensitivity and emphasizes the importance of promptly detecting the allergen to prevent further exposure. Awareness of airborne allergic contact dermatitis to acrylates is useful in occupational disease reviews. Additionally, efforts should be made to minimize airborne methacrylate concentrations to reduce sensitization risk.",

Detailed information regarding the aggregate structures was obtained by static light scattering (SLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). This could be correlated with the molecular architecture of the copolymers and the degree of ionisation of the PAA block. Generally, it is found that the aggregation numbers become smaller upon fully charging the PAA head group and only for dodecyl acrylate really well-defined micellar aggregates are formed.

    "abstract": "Nitroaromatic compounds have a wide range of applications. However, they pose a significant threat to both the environment and human health. Ionic liquid hydrogels (ILs-gels) have emerged as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option for various applications. However, conventional ILs-gels are known to possess mechanical flaws or defects. The procedure utilized a facile synthesis route that involved the polymerization of acrylamide (AM) and ionic liquids (ILs) to create a novel candidate for nanoparticle absorption. This study resolved this issue by creating toughened hydrophobic combined hydrogels synthesized through the addition of SiO2@poly(butyl acrylate) core-shell inorganic-organic hybrid latex particles (SiO2@PBA) to the AM-ILs mixture. The SiO2@PBA particles were chosen to provide the hydrogels with exceptional stretchability (up to 4050% strain) and high mechanical properties (tensile strength of 126 kPa) by acting as both a nanotoughener and a cross-linking point for hydrophobic linkage. Additionally, the P(AM/ILs)-SiO2@PBA hydrogel served as a template for the in situ and stable formation of palladium (Pd) nanoparticles. By incorporation of these Pd nanoparticles as catalysts into P(AM/ILs)-SiO2@PBA hydrogel carriers, the resulting P(AM/ILs)-SiO2@PBA/Pd hydrogels exhibited the ability to catalyze the degradation of p-nitrophenol. Remarkably, even after 15 applications, the efficiency of the degradation process remained consistently above 90%. Thus, the innovative SiO2@PBA toughened ILs-hydrogel design strategy can be utilized to develop robust and stretchable hydrogel materials for catalytic use in the sewage disposal industry.",

The thermal analysis of samples was done by differential scanning calorimetry, and the results were compared by the previous studies with MMA/n-butyl acrylate (BA) and MMA/2-ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA). The glass transition temperature (T g) values show that the latexes prepared using BA and EHA as comonomer was suitable for binder purpose, but in the present study the T g is not suitable in case of BMA as higher acrylate comonomer. That may be due to more cross-linking in MMA-BMA-PPGDA. The results conclude that the BA and EHA can be used as the binder, but the use of BMA is limited for the binder in coating applications.",

    "year": 2017,
    "abstract": "The linear and nonlinear oscillatory shear, extensional and combined rheology-dielectric spectroscopy of hybrid polymer nanocomposites for semiconductive applications were investigated in this study. The main focus was the influence of processing conditions on percolated poly(ethylene-butyl acrylate) (EBA) nanocomposite hybrids containing graphite nanoplatelets (GnP) and carbon black (CB). The rheological response of the samples was interpreted in terms of dispersion properties, filler distortion from processing, filler percolation, as well as the filler orientation and distribution dynamics inside the matrix. Evidence of the influence of dispersion properties was found in linear viscoelastic dynamic frequency sweeps, while the percolation of the nanocomposites was detected in nonlinearities developed in dynamic strain sweeps. Using extensional rheology, hybrid samples with better dispersion properties lead to a more pronounced strain hardening behavior, while samples with a higher volume percentage of fillers caused a drastic reduction in strain hardening. The rheo-dielectric time-dependent response showed that in the case of nanocomposites containing only GnP, the orientation dynamics leads to non-conductive samples. However, in the case of hybrids, the orientation of the GnP could be offset by the dispersing of the CB to bridge the nanoplatelets. The results were interpreted in the framework of a dual PE-BA model, where the fillers would be concentrated mainly in the BA regions. Furthermore, better dispersed hybrids obtained using mixing screws at the expense of filler distortion via extrusion processing history were emphasized through the rheo-dielectric tests.",

    "abstract": "Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs), produced by incorporating inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) into polymer matrices, have gained significant attention as promising candidates for solid‐state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the aggregation of dense inorganic fillers results in nonuniform CPEs, thereby impeding LMB performance. Here, we fabricated in‐situ photo‐polymerized CPEs by incorporating different weight ratios (0–20 wt%) of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) into a polymer electrolyte system composed of poly(butyl acrylate)‐based elastomer and succinonitrile‐based plastic crystal phases. The rapid photo‐polymerization process (~5 min) enabled homogeneous dispersion of LLZTO within the CPE matrix at 10 wt% LLZTO (L10), resulting in the high ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm−1 at 25°C) and mechanical elasticity (elongation at break ≈ 1250%) compared to those of CPE without LLZTO (L0). As a result, the L10‐based LMB with a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode exhibited a high capacity of 166.7 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5C, significantly higher than those of L0 (74.0 mAh g−1) and L20 (104.8 mAh g−1). In comparison, in‐situ thermal polymerized CPE with 10 wt% LLZTO NPs showed aggregation of NPs due to slow polymerization kinetics (~2 h), resulting in inferior LMB cycling performance compared to the L10. This work highlights the importance of in‐situ photo‐polymerized CPEs with homogenous dispersion of inorganic NPs to achieve high ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness suitable for the stable operation of LMBs.image",

The low hardness of films formed by water-based anticorrosion coatings and their poor anticorrosion effect can be resulted from the addition of hydrophilic substances, which make it easy for water penetration. In this experiment, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), butyl acrylate (BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and acrylic acid (AA) were used as the polymerization monomers to enhance the hardness, adhesion, and film-forming properties of the coatings by introducing the epoxy bond of GMA in the synthesis. The appropriate formula ratios for the waterborne coatings were determined by conditioning the content of wetting agent, thickener, levelling agent, defoamer, and modified acrylic-based resin. Based on this formula, suitable additive ratios of graphene were determined by condition experiments. When the addition ratio of graphene was 0.6wt% - 0.8wt%, the obtained coatings exhibited satisfactory hardness, film-forming properties, strong adhesion and anticorrosive properties.

    "abstract": "Microplastics (MPs) are increasingly recognized as emerging contaminants in aquatic environments; however, their occurrence and fate in tropical wastewater treatment systems remain poorly understood. This study provides the first inland–island comparison of MP removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Thailand’s Eastern Economic Corridor. Influent and effluent samples were collected from six WWTPs, encompassing five treatment types: oxidation ditch, aerated lagoon, stabilization pond, aerated tank, and sand filtration combined with reverse osmosis. Polymeric composition and size distribution were examined in parallel with conventional water quality indicators. Across all sites, polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene dominated influent MPs, together accounting for 57–92% of total abundance. Inland plants received heterogeneous municipal wastewater, including domestic inputs and agricultural runoff. In contrast, island facilities consistently showed PE-enriched influents (45–60%) in site F, reflecting tourism-driven reliance on single-use plastics and personal care products. In addition, several minor polymers were identified, including poly (vinyl stearate) (up to 26%), polyamide, polytetrafluoroethylene and ethylene–butyl acrylate, highlighting overlooked pathways of MP entry into WWTPs. Fine MPs (100–300 μm) comprised over two-thirds of influent particles, with stabilization ponds reaching 16,000 MP m−3. Removal efficiency ranged from 86.0% to 98.5%. Spearman’s correlation and multiple linear regression analyses revealed strong positive relationships between MPs and both total suspended solids (TSS) and turbidity. Suspended solids parameters emerged as the most reliable predictor of MP abundance (adjusted R2 = 0.91, p = 0.001). This finding highlights TSS coupled with turbidity as a practical, cost-effective indicator for monitoring MPs in tropical WWTPs.

The bacterial cells were immobilized on the self-plasticized hydrogen ion (H+)-selective acrylic membrane electrode surface to form a catalytic layer. Hydrogen ionophore I was incorporated in the poly(n-butyl acrylate) [poly(nBA)] as a pH ionophore. Catalytic decomposition of κ-carrageenan by the bienzymatic cascade reaction produced neoagarobiose, an inorganic sulfate ion and a proton. The latter was detectable by H+ ion transducer for indirect potentiometric quantification of κ-carrageenan concentration. The use of a disposable screen-printed Ag/AgCl electrode (SPE) provided no cleaning requirement and enabled κ-carrageenan detection to be carried out conveniently without cross contamination in a complex food sample. The SPE-based microbial biosensor response was found to be reproducible with high reproducibility and relative standard deviation (RSD) at 2.6% (n = 3). The whole cell biosensor demonstrated a broad dynamic linear response range to κ-carrageenan from 0.2–100 ppm in 20 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.5 with a detection limit at 0.05 ppm and a Nernstian sensitivity of 58.78±0.87 mV/decade (R2 = 0.995).

Surface wettability of hydrophilic jute fiber is tuned by attaching long chain hydrocarbon molecules, namely butyl methacrylate, octyl acrylate and lauryl methacrylate, using gamma radiation. Lauryl methacrylate is found to be the most suitable agent among the molecules used for generating desired extent of hydrophobicity.

The composites were prepared using different loadings of silica fume and commercial silica in EPDM and NBR composites. Structural characterization of silica and SF was done using X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface of silica fume waste was modified using poly methyl methacrylate/butyl acrylate through emulsion polymerization to increase the interaction between silica and rubber, then consequently better dispersion in rubber matrix was obtained. The mSF waste was characterized using FT-IR spectra and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe investigated rubber mixes and vulcanizates were evaluated by measuring the curing characteristics, mechanical testing, thermogravimetric analysis and morphological studies (SEM). The mechanical properties of composites including tensile strength, elongation at break and modulus were estimated and analyzed.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results revealed that the composites (NBR and EPDM) containing mSF as filler exhibited better rheological and mechanical properties compared to unmodified silica waste and commercial silica. The SEM analysis indicated that the mSF was homogeneously dispersed through the surface of NBR and EPDM composites. Also, results showed that (NBR and EPDM) composites exhibited remarkable improvements in tensile strength, elongation at break and hardness in the presence of mSF; they also showed an increase in the thermal stability. This means that the treatment of surface SF can improve its dispersion in rubber.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nSilica cannot be applied in rubber matrix without surface modification because of their incompatibility; their dispersion is not good without surface modification.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe modified silica surface is considered as effective reinforcing filler which can replace other fillers because of its lower surface energy and enhanced intercalating behavior in rubber.\n\n\nSocial implications\nThis study is just a start in establishing rubber projects with wide applications in the industry and providing a cheap local product while preserving the quality and that is the use of factory waste, which helps in protecting the environment from pollution.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nmSF is cheap with relatively high purity, which make rubber/mSF composites appear as new grade of material that can be used in different media rather than rubber.\n",

And the hydrolysis product poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PEO45-b-PAA35) was obtained and used as a template to synthesise nanostructured poly(o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD). The influence of hydrolysis degrees of PEO45-b-PAA35 on the size and electrochemical properties of PoPD was investigated. Results showed that the PoPD particles have uniform sizes, and their size could be tuned with the hydrolysis degree of PEO45-b-PAA35. The average diameter and length of PoPD were less than 86 and 135 nm, and the size of these particles was increased with the increase of hydrolysis degree of PEO45-b-PAA35. Electrochemical characterisation proves that the particle with a smaller size had a better electrochemical activity. When the hydrolysis time was 12 h, the PoPD had the best specific capacitance compared with other samples. The discharge specific capacitance calculated by chronopotentiometric test of this sample is reached 809 F·g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A·g−1.",

    "abstract": "Acrylate polymer is widely used to manufacture display films as an adhesive. Improper disposal of acrylate polymer-containing display film waste (a kind of E-waste) may cause serious environmental problems. As an effort to develop a display film waste treatment strategy, this study applied a solvent-based method to recover acrylate polymer from display film waste. The solubility of acrylate polymer (e.g. poly(tert-butyl acrylate)) in 18 different organic solvents was calculated using Hansen solubility parameters. As a result, 2-butanol and methyl acetate were chosen as organic solvents for the acrylate polymer recovery from the display film waste. Effects of various recovery parameters (e.g. temperature, time, and stirring speed) on the recovery of acrylate polymer in five different solvent systems consisting of 2-butanol and methyl acetate (2-butanol, methyl acetate, 1:1 mixture, 1:2 mixture, and 2:1 mixture) were explored. 2-Butanol was found to be a better solvent than any others because it is more hydrophobic than methyl acetate. The recovery condition at which the highest acrylate polymer recovery yield in 2-butanol was obtained was T  =  30 °C, t  =  1 h, and stirring speed of 250 r/min, reaching 8.28 wt%.

Herein, we perform a detailed structure-property relationship study on carboxylic acid side chain bearing polyacrylates in order to provide design criteria for the manipulation of their cellular interactions. Redox-initiated RAFT polymerization of three tert-butyl protected N-acylated amino ester based acrylate monomers of different substitution and degree of polymerization (DP) yielded defined and pH-responsive carboxylic acid side chain polymers upon deprotection (N-acetyl, DP 1: P(M1); N-propionyl, DP 1: P(E1), DP 2: P(E2)). Flow cytometry studies revealed time-dependent cell association with P(E2) > P(E1) > P(M1) at any given time point. Importantly, the type of cyanine dye used for labeling was found to significantly influence the cellular processing of the polymers. Changing the dye from Cy5 to its sulfonated version sulfoCy5 resulted in a much lower cellular association. Moreover, Cy5-labeled polymers were targeted to mitochondria, while sulfoCy5 modification caused a significant change of the cellular fate of the polymers towards lysosome trafficking. This study highlights the importance of selecting a suitable dye but also demonstrates the possibilities for the rational design of organelle-specific targeting of carboxylated polyacrylates.",

The resistivity temperature stability of the grafted semi‐conductive composites, as well as the space charge distribution and direct current (DC) breakdown characteristics of cross‐linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation using the composites as the electrode is investigated. The results show that MAH grafting can significantly reduce the volume resistivity of semi‐conductive composites, especially at a higher temperature, to suppress the PTC effect.

    "abstract": "Energy-dissipation elastomers relying on their viscoelastic behavior of chain segments in the glass transition region can effectively suppress vibrations and noises in various fields, yet the operating frequency of those elastomers is difficult to control precisely and its range is narrow. Here, we report a synergistic strategy for constructing polymer-fluid-gels that provide controllable ultrahigh energy dissipation over a broad frequency range, which is difficult by traditional means. This is realized by precisely tailoring the relaxation of confined polymer fluids in the elastic networks. The symbiosis of this combination involves: elastic networks forming an elastic matrix that displays reversible deformation and polymer fluids reptating back and forth to dissipate mechanical energy. Using prototypical poly (n-butyl acrylate) elastomers, we demonstrate that the polymer-fluid-gels exhibit a controllable ultrahigh energy-dissipation property (loss factor larger than 0.5) with a broad frequency range (10−2 ~ 108 Hz). Energy absorption of the polymer-fluid-gels is over 200 times higher than that of commercial damping materials under the same dynamic stress. Moreover, their modulus is quasi-stable in the operating frequency range. In most cases the frequency range of a damping material is adapted to a specific application. Huang et al. design a gel filled with a polymeric fluid that bypasses this problem and offers an unusually broad window over which vibrational energy is effectively dissipated.",

The copolymer was synthesized by emulsion polymerization, the corresponding membrane was prepared through phase inversion method and the gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) were obtained by immersing the membranes into 1M LiPF6 liquid electrolyte. The performances of the copolymer, the membranes and its GPEs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, mechanical stability, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analyzer, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge test. The results show that the copolymer is obtained through opening the double bonds CC of its monomers.

The PBMG particle size was characterized by dynamic laser scattering, and the morphology of the particles was characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The exfoliation of the modified boron nitride (MBN) flakes was verified by TEM and Raman microscopy. The mechanical properties and the thermal conductivity of the EP/PBMG/MBN composite were determined at various constituent contents. Results showed that the unnotched impact strength of the composite increased by 147%, the flexural strength increased by 49.1%, and the thermal conductivity increased by 98% compared with pristine EP at a PBMG content of 5 wt% and MBN content of 7 wt%.

With this method, low molecular weight co‐oligomers are studied using MALDI‐ToF‐MS. Both the oligomers in the aqueous phase and the oligomers in the particle phase can be seen. Varying the initiator system, it is observed that the initiation step has an influence on the composition of these oligomers and hence on the absorption on to latex particles. Chain length dependent average compositions in the aqueous phase are observed. The chain length dependent oligomer composition can be described in terms of kinetic effects and preferential/selective adsorption of co‐oligomers on the particle surface. The kinetic effects and the extent of adsorption on the particle phase are both dependent on the various end groups. The preferential/selective adsorption of co‐oligomers on the particle phase is explained on the basis of solubility and interactions with the surface. The chain length dependent absolute oligomer amount decreases exponentially with chain length as confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.This information is important to further understand the events of the aqueous phase of an emulsion copolymerization as well as the entry of radicals into the particles.\nimage",

The influence of interactions, mediated by temperature, nature of metal ions, and ion content, on the linear viscoelastic behavior of both single and double dynamics transient networks is systematically investigated by small amplitude oscillatory shear and creep rheometry. The experimental results reveal that the dynamics of networks with two different metal-ligand cross-links is much faster than expected, characterized by the average sticker lifetime rather than a discrete contribution of each metal-ligand complex. We model the dynamics with the help of our modified tube-based time marching algorithm by accounting for both association/dissociation dynamics of metal-ligand coordination and the entanglement dynamics. Two parameters are defined in the model, namely, the proportion of dangling ends and the average time during which a sticker is free.

Due to their emitted volatile organic compounds, these paints are associated with different work-related diseases and are known to emit an unpleasant odor. In this study six acrylic paints for artists were analyzed regarding their odor-active constituents. Therefore, the samples were extracted with dichloromethane and purified via solvent assisted flavor evaporation prior to analysis of the distillates by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), and GC-GC-MS/O. Additionally all samples were sensorially characterized by a trained sensory panel. The identified odorous substances were primarily benzene derivatives (styrene, ethylbenzene, allylbenzene, propylbenzene) with a plastic-like, aromatic and solvent-like odor. Thereby, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (naphthalene, indane, and tetralin derivatives) contributed to the plastic- and mothball-like odor whereas acrylic monomers (butyl acrylate) were found to be responsible for a mushroom-like and geranium leaf-like odor. As most of these substances are also known to be harmful, a reduction or replacement of these substances by less toxic and non-odor active ingredients is likely to turn out to be advisable in order to reduce the odor and potential negative physiological effects of paints.",

Herein, we propose the design principles of polymer networks that are hyperelastic yet adhesive by rationalizing mechanical heterogeneities.

We synthesize the networks by harnessing the oxygen inhibition mechanism, construct a polymerization phase diagram by reconciling the kinetics of polymerization and radical quenching of oxygen, and establish a power law criterion for the transition from a viscoelastic adhesive network to a hyperelastic adhesive network. We illustrate the principle with heterogeneous poly(butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) networks, achieving hysteresis <5% and adhesion energy >300 J/m2. We show that the adhesion energy-thickness relation of hyperelastic adhesive polymer networks is nonlinear below a transition thickness. Hyperelastic and adhesive stretchable materials potentialize high-cycle and fatigue-resistant soft human-machine interfaces and beyond.

The results showed that P(t-BA-co-GMA) nanospheres could form crack-free structural colors on polyester fabrics, and the colors vary with the mass ratio of t-BA and GMA to obtain five different colors. The different particle sizes of the different P(t-BA-co-GMA) nanospheres with different refractive indexes and the arrangement of short-range ordered and long-range disordered in microstructures may be the reason of different angle-independent structural colors on polyester fabrics.

Based on dynamic light scattering (DLS), the PnBA30-b-POEGA70 and PnBA27-b-POEGA73 (where the subscripts denote wt.% composition of the components) copolymers formed micelles of 10 nm and 24 nm in water.

A thorough NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) characterization of the LSR-loaded PnBA-b-POEGA nanocarriers was conducted. Strong intermolecular interactions between the biphenyl ring and the butyl chain of LSR with the methylene signals of PnBA were evidenced by 2D-NOESY experiments. The highest hydrophobicity of the PnBA27-b-POEGA73 micelles contributed to an efficient encapsulation of LSR into the micelles exhibiting a greater value of %EE compared to PnBA30-b-POEGA70 + 50% LSR nanocarriers. Ultrasound release profiles of LSR signified that a great amount of the encapsulated LSR is strongly attached to both PnBA30-b-POEGA70 and PnBA27-b-POEGA73 micelles.",

The quality of printed images is greatly influenced by the toner production method and material formulation. Chemically in situ polymerization methods are currently preferred. This paper aims to optimize the characteristics of a composite produced through emulsion polymerization using common raw materials for electrophotographic toner production.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nEmulsion polymerization provides the possibility to optimize the physical and color properties of the final products. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize variables affecting particle size (PS), PS distribution (PSD), glass transition temperature (Tg°C), color properties (ΔE) and monomer conversion. Box–Behnken experimental design with three levels of styrene and butyl acrylate monomer ratios, carbon black pigment and sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant was used for RSM optimization. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis and surface morphology of composite particles were examined.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results indicated that colorants with small PS, narrow PSDs, spherical shape morphology, acceptable thermal and color properties and a high percentage of conversion could be easily prepared by optimization of material parameters in this method. The anticipated outcome of the present inquiry holds promise as a guiding beacon toward the realization of electrographic toner of superior quality and exceptional efficacy, a vital factor for streamlined mass production.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, for the first time, material parameters were evaluated to determine their impact on the characteristics of emulsion polymerized toner composites.\n",

    "abstract": "Their inherent directional information renders patchy particles interesting building blocks for advanced applications in materials science. In this study, a feasible method to fabricate patchy silicon dioxide microspheres is demonstrated, which they are able to equip with tailor-made polymeric materials as patches. Their fabrication method relies on a solid-state supported microcontact printing (µCP) routine optimized for the transfer of functional groups to capillary-active substrates, which is used to introduce amino functionalities as patches to a monolayer of particles. Acting as anchor groups for polymerization, photo-iniferter reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) is used to graft polymer from the patch areas. Accordingly, particles with poly(N-acryloyl morpholine), poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide), and poly(n-butyl acrylate) are prepared as representative acrylic acid-derived functional patch materials. To facilitate their handling in water, a passivation strategy of the particles for aqueous systems is introduced. The protocol introduced here, therefore, promises a vast degree of freedom in engineering the surface properties of highly functional patchy particles. This feature is unmatched by other techniques to fabricate anisotropic colloids. The method, thus, can be considered a platform technology, culminating in the fabrication of particles that possess locally precisely formed patches on particles at a low µm scale with a high material functionality.",

The results showed that the critical micelle concentration of PtBA-b-P(DMAEMA-co-PEGMEMA) was 2.55 mg/L. As the value of pH increased from 2 to 11, their particle size decreased from 178 nm to 130 nm.

A RAFT polymerization using 2,2‐(thiocarbonylbis(sulfanediyl))bis(2‐methylpropanoic acid) 4 as a chain transfer agent, followed by a Mitsunobu esterification and a deprotection of the tert‐butyl ester groups with trifluoroacetic acid, provided the desired acidic polymers in moderate to good yields. The synthesized polymers were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and by gel permeation chromatography. The number‐average molecular weights measured for 1a–1c were in good agreement with the expected values.

    "abstract": "It is highly desired yet challenging to fabricate biocompatible injectable self-healing hydrogels with anti-bacterial adhesion properties for complex wounds that can autonomously adapt to different shapes and depths and can promote angiogenesis and dermal collagen synthesis for rapid wound healing. Herein, an injectable zwitterionic hydrogel with excellent self-healing property, good cytocompatibility, and antibacterial adhesion was developed from a thermoresponsive ABA triblock copolymer poly[(N-isopropyl acrylamide)-co-(butyl acrylate)-co-(sulfobetaine methacrylate)]-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly[(N-isopropyl acrylamide)-co-(butyl acrylate)-co-(sulfobetaine methacrylate)] (PZOPZ). The prepared PZOPZ hydrogel exhibits a distinct thermal-induced sol-gel transition around physiological temperature and could be easily applied in a sol state and in situ gelled to adapt complex wounds of different shapes and depths for complete coverage. Meanwhile, the hydrogel possesses a rapid self-healing ability and can recover autonomously from damage to maintain structural and functional integrity. In addition, the CCK-8 and 2D/3D cell culture experiments revealed that the PZOPZ hydrogel dressing shows low cytotoxicity to L929 cells and can effectively prevent the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In vivo investigations verified that the PZOPZ hydrogel could increase angiogenesis and dermal collagen synthesis and shorten the transition from the inflammatory to the proliferative stage, thereby providing more favorable conditions for faster wound healing. Overall, this work provides a promising strategy to develop injectable zwitterionic hydrogel dressings with multiple functions for clinic wound management.",

However, dedifferentiation during chondrocyte subculture prevents the application of cartilage tissue engineering. Therefore, prevention of this dedifferentiation is required.

Chondrocytes spread on PTHFA and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), whereas their spreading is delayed on PMEA and PMe2A. When primary chondrocytes are subcultured on these polymers, the expression levels of cartilaginous genes are higher on PMEA and PMe2A than on PET and PTHFA. Integrin contribution to the initial cell adhesion is lower on PMEA and PMe2A than on PTHFA and PET. This low level of integrin contribution to cell adhesion may cause a delay in cell spreading and the maintenance of cartilaginous gene expression. These results indicate that PMEA and PMe2A may be favorable substrates for chondrocyte subculture and cartilage tissue engineering.",

The morphology of P tBA- b-PAzoMA copolymers was manipulated by dissolving them in mixed dimethylformamide (DMF)/hexanol solvents. When P tBA- b-PAzoMA was dissolved in DMF-rich (neutral) solvents, a favorable interaction between the DMF molecules and both blocks resulted in a random-coiled conformation. The unconfined morphology facilitated the formation of both nonassociated and head-to-head organized azobenzene mesogens, which promoted fluorescence emission. When hexanol, a P tBA-selective solvent, was added to DMF, the solvency of P tBA- b-PAzoMA worsened, leading to its assembly into micelles, with PAzoMA in the micelle core. The confinement of azobenzene moieties in the micelle core hindered their trans-to- cis photoisomerization, thereby considerably decreasing the kinetics of photoisomerization and the population of cis isomers. Additionally, a nanoconfined geometry resulted in compactly packed chromophores, causing fluorescence loss. When P tBA- b-PAzoMA was exposed to UV light, the increased number of cis isomers hampered the closely packed mesogens, resulting in a substantial enhancement of fluorescence emission. When the mole fraction of the PAzoMA block was increased, P tBA- b-PAzoMA formed clusters, causing the slow kinetics of photoisomerization and fluorescence quenching.",

    "abstract": "Invisible high-security anticounterfeiting polymeric inks exhibiting both photochromism and fluorescence emission for security marking have attracted significant interest recently. In the current study, flexible and invisible high-security anticounterfeiting inks were developed via the chemical incorporation of spiropyran into copolymer latex nanoparticles based on methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate by semi-continuous miniemulsion polymerization. The anticounterfeiting inks are based on latex nanoparticles with various polarities and glass transition temperatures (Tg) and have spherical morphology with narrow size distribution in the range of 50–80 nm. The inks can simultaneously display photochromism (colorless to purple) and fluorescence emission (highly intense and bright red emission) upon UV irradiation in a fast and facile manner using a minimum concentration of spiropyran (about 1 wt% with respect to the polymer content). The morphology investigation and measurement of contact angles on the surface of the papers impregnated with stimuli-chromic latex samples display that the latex nanoparticles with different flexibilities have appropriate coating ability and stability on the surface of the cellulosic substrates due to the formation of hydrogen bonding. The investigation of the photochromic properties and fluorescence emission of the samples shows that the latex particles with higher polarity of the polymer chains have significant photochromic intensity and fluorescence emission as well as high photofatigue resistance, photoswitchability, and reversibility without displaying negative photochromism. Fast responsivity upon UV irradiation was observed for the sample with a Tg of about 33 °C and medium polarity, which indicated that the kinetics of the SP ↔ MC isomerization was a function of the polarity and flexibility of the polymer chains. The invisible high-security ink prepared using the photochromic and fluorescent latex nanoparticles with the highest optical properties was loaded on a stamp with different marks and used for print-marking different security documents, such as a certificate, money, and passport. The printed marks and finger-print on the security documents displayed photochromism and red fluorescence upon UV irradiation (365 nm). Spraying the latex nanoparticles on cellulosic papers induced high-resolution rewritable photopatterns on the cellulose substrate after UV illumination under different masks. Thus, the strategy developed to prepare high-security anticounterfeiting inks is an efficient, facile, and fast method for authentication applications.",

In this work, a novel approach is presented focusing on process reintensification by combining pervaporation and sorption enhanced reactive processes, the simulated moving-bed membrane reactor (SMBR), also known as PermSMBR. Different configurations of membranes combined with the simulated moving-bed reactor (SMBR) were investigated: integrated, comprising membranes packed with the Amberlyst-15 ion-exchange resin, and coupled, consisting of several hydrophilic membranes each of which was followed by a fixed-bed adsorptive reactor. Mathematical models were implemented to predict the PermSMBR performance with the different configurations. To achieve this, different experimental runs were carried out to validate the mathematical model for the simulated moving-bed reactor. Then, fundamental pervaporation data were taken into account to investigate numerically the PermSMBR process. The maximum performance was achieved with the integrated PermSMBR configuration, which was the best strategy for BAc production, with a productivity of 8.00 (kgBAc (Lₐdₛ–¹·day–¹)), which is 33% higher than that obtained in the conventional SMBR. Moreover, this strategy leads to a significant reduction in the consumption of the eluent, 32%, relative to SMBR for the same conversion (≥99%) and purity criteria (≥99.5%).

Three patients with ACD from Dexcom G6 tested positive to this sensitizer. They were also allergic to isobornyl acrylate, a sensitizer present both in Dexcom G6 and in other medical devices previously used by these patients. Objective The aim of the study was to report the first 4 cases sensitized to 2,2′-methylenebis(6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) monoacrylate without a simultaneous allergy to isobornyl acrylate.

Results All 4 cases tested positive to 2,2′-methylenebis(6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) monoacrylate at either 1.0% or 1.5% in petrolatum, whereas 20 controls tested negative to both concentrations. Conclusions The cases reported here provide further evidence of 2,2′-methylenebis(6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) monoacrylate as a relevant culprit sensitizer in patients with ACD from Dexcom G6. However, the initially used patch test concentration (0.3%) did not suffice to elicit positive reactions in these cases, which is why patch testing at 1.5% is recommended.",

Adsorption and denaturation of fibrinogen on the polymers increased as the ratio of PBA increased. The incremental change corresponded to the amount of intermediate water included in the hydrated polymers. The composition of PBA altered the features of the phase-separated structures observed on the polymer/phosphate-buffered saline interfaces. Microscopically, the denaturation of fibrinogen was observed as the formation of fibrous networks on the interfaces by atomic force microscopy. Fibrinogen adsorption and denaturation were enhanced on the water-rich domains in the phase-separated structures on the non-blood-compatible polymers. This suggested that the excellent blood compatibility of PMEA is caused by the constrained adsorption and denaturation of fibrinogen in water-rich domains, possibly due to the high content of intermediate water in this region. This work provides essential scientific foundations for the design and fabrication of highly functional biomaterials.",

At room temperature, 1 emits luminescence light of wavelength 460 nm in the solid state upon excitation by UV light of wavelength 280 nm.

For both type of reactions, more than 99% conversion of the substrates is found to occur for electronically activated p-nitro bromobenzene using 1 mol % of 1. Further, modern DFT calculations are performed to decipher the mechanistic insight on the preferable pathways of the Mizoroki-Heck cross-coupling reaction.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Electrophotographic printing and copying processes primarily use toner, which is a mixture of colorant, polymer, and additives. Toner can be made using traditional mechanical milling techniques or more contemporary chemical polymerization techniques. Suspension polymerization provides spherical particles with less stabilizer adsorption, homogeneous monomers, higher purity, and easier control of the reaction temperature. In contrast to these advantages, however, the particle size resulting from suspension polymerization is too large for toner. To overcome this disadvantage, devices such as high-speed stirrers and homogenizers can be used to reduce the size of the droplets. This research investigated the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) instead of carbon black as the pigment in toner development. We succeeded in achieving a good dispersion of four different types of CNT, specifically modified with NH2 and Boron or unmodified with long or short chains in water rather than chloroform, using sodium n-dodecyl sulfate as a stabilizer. We then performed polymerization of the monomers styrene and butyl acrylate in the presence of the different CNT types and found that the best monomer conversion and largest particles (in the micron range) occurred with CNTs modified with boron. The insertion of a charge control agent into the polymerized particles was achieved. Monomer conversion of over 90% was realized with all concentrations of MEP-51, whereas conversion was under 70% with all concentrations of MEC-88. Furthermore, analysis with dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that all polymerized particles were in the micron size range, suggesting that our newly developed toner particles were less harmful and environmentally friendly products than those typically and commercially available. The SEM micrographs clearly showed good dispersion and attachment of the CNTs on the polymerized particles (no CNT aggregation was found), which has never been published before.",

    "abstract": "With extremely high specific capacity, silicon has attracted enormous interest as a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, silicon suffers from a large volume variation during charge/discharge cycles, which leads to the pulverization of the silicon and subsequent separation from the conductive additives, eventually resulting in rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. Here, it is shown that the utilization of a self-healable supramolecular polymer, which is facilely synthesized by copolymerization of tert-butyl acrylate and an ureido-pyrimidinone monomer followed by hydrolysis, can greatly reduce the side effects caused by the volume variation of silicon particles. The obtained polymer is demonstrated to have an excellent self-healing ability due to its quadruple-hydrogen-bonding dynamic interaction. An electrode using this self-healing supramolecular polymer as binder exhibits an initial discharge capacity as high as 4194 mAh g-1 and a Coulombic efficiency of 86.4%, and maintains a high capacity of 2638 mAh g-1 after 110 cycles, revealing significant improvement of the electrochemical performance in comparison with that of Si anodes using conventional binders.

    "abstract": "The study of trialkylborane as a component of the initiating system with oxygen was carried out using the example of graft polymerization of alkyl(meth)acrylate vinyl butyl ether copolymer units on pectin polysaccharide. The amine complex triethylborane-hexamethylenediamine was introduced into a boiling mixture of an aqueous solution of pectin in vinyl butyl ether, after which a solution of the active monomer, alkyl(meth)acrylate, containing methacrylic acid, was introduced by the compensation method to isolate triethylborane from the complex. As a result of synthesis from a mixture containing butyl acrylate, three immiscible parts were formed: organic, aqueous, and between them a “sponge” that did not dissolve in any of the phases. In the case of methyl methacrylate, only two parts were formed in the mixture: organic and aqueous. Water-soluble and organic polymers were dried under vacuum conditions to constant weight at T = 20–25 °C. Gravimetric analysis showed that the “sponge” was a mixture of water-soluble and organic polymers at 50:50 ratio. To do this, the dried polymers were dissolved alternately in water and vinyl butyl ether. Graft copolymers pectin-methyl methacrylate-vinyl butyl ether and pectin-butyl acrylate-vinyl butyl ether were isolated from the aqueous phase of the synthesized systems, in relation to the introduced acrylate. In comparison with the original pectin, the molecular weight of the water-soluble fraction increased significantly. Comparison of the IR spectrum of the graft copolymer pectin-methyl methacrylate-vinyl butyl ether with the IR spectra of pectin and the IR spectrum of pectin-methyl methacrylate indicated that all the bands characteristic of pectin, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyvinyl butyl ether were observed for the new polymer sample. Freeze-dried samples of pectin and pectin-methyl methacrylate-vinyl butyl ether graft copolymer were examined using scanning electron microscopy. A comparative analysis showed a change in the structure of pectin fibers as a result of its copolymerization with a copolymer of methyl meth-acrylate-vinyl butyl ether. The obtained data confirm the addition of synthetic polymers alkyl (meth) acrylate-vinyl butyl ether to the basis of the pectin macromolecule.

Michael addition yielded acetyl-protected cytosine/guanine containing acrylic monomers with flexible spacers between the hydrogen bonding units and the acrylic backbone. Free radical polymerization of nucleobase-containing monomers afforded acetyl-protected cytosine/guanine homopolymers and random copolymers with n-butyl acrylate. Nucleobase incorporation significantly affected thermal, thermomechanical, rheological, morphological properties, and adhesive performance of polyacrylates. Guanine/cytosine-containing copolymers each exhibited a single glass transition (Tg) that increased with increasing nucleobase content. Self-association of acetyl cytosine and acetyl guanine units converted low Tg polyacrylates to physically crosslinked networks with mechanical integrity. Solution casting acetyl guanine-containing copolymers with 8 mol% or higher guanine content yielded free-standing films with microphase-separated morphologies. Acetyl cytosine-containing copolymers with 15 mol% or more cytosine formed free-standing films with less microphase-separation compared to the guanine copolymers. 1H NMR titration experiments established a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between acetyl cytosine and acetyl guanine monomers in CDCl3, similar to guanine-cytosine association. However, the acetyl protecting group hindered the formation of triple hydrogen bonding, resulting in double hydrogen bonding between acetyl cytosine and acetyl guanine with an intermediate binding strength comparable to their self-associations. Acetyl guanine-containing copolymers with 3 mol% acetyl guanine exhibited higher peel strength on stainless steel and higher extended service frequency range compared to cytosine-containing copolymers and various pressure sensitive adhesive controls.",

Herein, a series of micelle-forming and micelle-shielding polymers were synthesized via RAFT polymerization. The copolymer poly[( n -butyl acrylate)- b -(2-(dimethyl amino)ethyl acrylamide)] (P( n BA- b -DMAEAm)) was assembled into cationic micelles and different shielding polymers were applied, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), poly(4-acryloyl morpholine) (PNAM) or P(NAM- b -AA) block copolymer.

The assemblies were investigated regarding their morphology, interaction with pDNA, cytotoxicity, transfection efficiency, polyplex uptake and endosomal escape. The naked cationic micelle exhibited superior transfection efficiency, but increased cytotoxicity. The addition of shielding polymers led to reduced toxicity. In particular, the triblock terpolymer micelle convinced with high cell viability and no significant loss in efficiency. The highest shielding effect was achieved by layering micelles with P(NAM- b -AA) supporting the colloidal stability at neutral zeta potential and completely restoring cell viability while maintaining moderate transfection efficiencies.

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are usually made from viscoelastic, high-molecular-weight copolymers, which are fine-tuned by adjusting the comonomer ratios, molecular weights, and cross-link densities to optimize the adhesion properties for the desired end-use. To create a lightly cross-linked network, an ultraviolet (UV) photoinitiator can be incorporated. Here, we present the first use of perfluorophenylazide chemistry to control precisely a polyacrylate network for application as a PSA. Upon UV irradiation, the highly reactive nitrene from the azide moiety reacts with nearby molecules through a C–H insertion reaction, resulting in cross-linking via covalent bonding. This approach offers three benefits: (1) a means to optimize adhesive properties without the addition of an external photoinitiator; (2) the ability to switch off the tack adhesion on demand via a high cross-linking density; and (3) a platform for additional chemical modification. A series of poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl acrylate) or poly(PFBA-co-BA) copolymers were synthesized and modified post-polymerization into the photo-reactive poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl acrylate) [azide-modified poly(PFBA-co-BA)] with various molar contents. When cast into films, the azide-modified copolymers with a high azide content achieved a very high shear resistance after UV irradiation, whereas the tack and peel adhesion decreased strongly with the increase in azide content, indicating that excessive cross-linking occurred. These materials are thus photo-switchable. However, in the low range of azide content, an optimum probe tack adhesion energy was obtained in films with a 0.3 mol % azide content, where a long stress plateau (indicating good fibrillation) with a high plateau stress was observed. An optimum peel adhesion strength was achieved with 0.5 mol % azide. Thus, the adhesion was finely controlled by the degree of cross-linking of the PSA, as determined by the azide content of the copolymer chain. Finally, as a demonstration of the versatility and advantages of the material platform, we show an azide–aldehyde–amine multicomponent modification of the azide copolymer to make a dye-functionalized film that retains its adhesive properties. This first demonstration of using azide functionality has enormous potential for functional PSA design.",

    "abstract": "Stretchable ionic conductors have been actively developed due to the increasing demand for wearable electrochemical platforms. Herein, we propose a convenient and effective strategy for tailoring the mechanical deformability of ionic conductors. The mixing of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, polymer gelator) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([BMI][TFSI], ionic liquid) produces mechanically stiff ionic conductors. To reduce the chain entanglement of polymer gelators and induce effective dissipation of applied stresses, flexible poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) with a low glass-transition temperature is additionally doped into the ionic conductor. An extremely stretchable (∼1500%) homogeneous ternary ionic conductor is obtained without a notable change in electrochemical characteristics, unless the content of PBA exceeds the macrophase separation limit of 3 wt %. In addition, the mechanical elasticity (1.8 × 105 Pa) and durability (e.g., recovery ratio of ∼86.3% after 1000 stretching/releasing cycles) of the conductor further support its suitability as a strain sensory platform. In contrast to conventional ionoskins that have to fit the area of target body parts, even a small piece of the ternary ionic conductor successfully monitors human motion over large areas by taking advantage of its superior deformability.",

This millipede is often subject to numerous industrial pollu-tants, but their effects on this species have not been studied so far. For laborat o ry studies, we made a 150 cm-long and 10 cm-wide experimental chamber, with marks every 10 cm. In the middle of the chamber, we placed 60 individuals that had an opportunity to move toward the source of odor or away from it. The behavior of the millipedes was recorded on video, and the direction in which each individual moved was observed for 5 minutes. In the experiments, we used 30 organic compounds: butyl acetate, diethyl oxalpropionate, butyl acrylate, diethyl ma-lonate, ortho-xylene, thymol, α-methylbenzylamine, carvacrol, hexane, pentane, biphenyl, cyclohexane, 2-methylfuran, 5-methylfurfural, furfuryl alcohol, 2-methyl butanoic acid, 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenoic acid, isovaleric acid, tert-butylacetic acid, propionic acid, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, 3-methyl-2-butanone, 2-pentanone, methyl acetoacetate, ethyl pyruvate, isobutyraldehyde, 2-ethoxyethanol, potassium sulfite, calcium sorbate, and sodium diacetate. These compounds are used in various industrial spheres, construction, agriculture, and food industry. With industrial waste, they are released into the environment and can potentially affect populations of R. kessleri . Of the 30 compounds, 23 had no significant effect on the locomotor activity of R. kessleri . The strongest repellent activity was exerted by isobutyraldehyde (the attractant coefficient measured 0.43 ± 0.40) and biphenyl (0.49 ± 0.11).

A weak attractant effect on R. kessleri was produced by 2-methylbutanoic acid (the attractant coefficient measuring 1.32 ± 0.48).

The terpolymers were characterized by Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR), Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). All synthesized terpolymers have molecular weights over 160,000 g/mol and solubility on several organic solvents. Terpolymers also showed high thermal stability by TGA and comonomers reduced Tg transitions and complex moduli along BuA content; the complex moduli clearly increased with ACN content. Intermediate aliquots taken during the sulfonation reaction were characterized indicate that incorporation of the sulfonic group decreases the thermal stability from over 350 °C in terpolymers down to 150 °C after sulfonation. The degree of sulfonation analyzed by TGA ranged between 11.2 and 15.9% leading to a proton conductivity interval from 2.9 to 4.0 mS/cm.

The structures of the schiff base-containing polymers and their corresponding complexes were characterized by means of infrared spectra and UV spectra. The thermal properties of the functionalized polymers and complexes were investigated by TGA, and the fluorescence properties of the complexes were also researched by fluorescence spectrum. The experimental results show that the complexes have fine thermal stability likely because of the bidentate chelate effect of base-containing polymer and the conjugative effect of salicylaldehyde hydrazone group on the side chain of poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate). More important, the salicylaldehyde hydrazone group on the side chains of poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate) can efficaciously sensitize the fluorescence emission of the center ion due to effective intramolecular energy transfer. All the Eu(III)/Yb(III) complexes exhibit characteristic photoluminescence peaks in the visible region. The fluorescence excitation spectra of the complexes were obtained by monitoring the emission of Eu3+/Yb3+ ion at 497 nm, and the peak at 433 nm was found to be the optimal excitation peak.

    "abstract": "Selective fragmentation of α,β-unsaturated esters into CC, CO, and OR fragments was investigated with the assistance of a gallane(pyridyl)iron complex Cp*(OC)Fe{(η1-HGaMes2)(η1-2-C5H4N)} (1, Cp*: η5-C5Me5, Mes: 2,4,6-Me3C6H2). The reaction of 1 with methyl acrylate in C7D8 afforded vinyliron complex Cp*(OC)2Fe(CHCH2) (2) and 4-membered Ga2O2 cyclic gallane [Mes2GaOMe]2 (3). The C-O and C-C bonds in t-butyl acrylate were cleaved by the reaction with complex 1, producing complex 2 and pyridine-coordinated gallane Mes2(t-BuO)Ga(pyridine) (4). The selective bond cleavage reactions proceeded by the reactions of 1 with methyl methacrylate and methyl 2-butenoate to afford Cp*(OC)2Fe(CR1CHR2) (R1 = Me, R2 = H (5), R1 = H, R2 = Me (6)) and 3. In contrast, compound 3 was formed in 11% NMR yield by the reaction of 1 with methyl 3-butenoate (β,γ-unsaturated ester), and complex mixtures of unidentified products were obtained by the reaction of 1 with methyl 4-pentenoate (γ,δ-unsaturated ester) and methyl propionate (saturated ester). The treatment of a cyclic ester, α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone, with 1 afforded a 4-membered Ga2O2 cyclic gallane dimer with Cp*(OC)2FeC(CH2)CH2CH2 substituents on the oxygen atoms, namely [Cp*(OC)2FeC(CH2)CH2CH2OGaMes2]2 (7). In addition, the bond cleavage reaction occurred by the reaction of 1 with allyl methyl ether to afford the (η3-allyl)iron complex Cp*(OC)Fe(η3-CH2CHCH2) (8) and 3. These results indicate that the existence of the -CC-C-OR fragment, regardless of the presence or absence of the CO group between the CC and OR fragments, is essential for the bond cleavage reaction.",

    "abstract": "The exploration of solid polymer-based composite electrolytes (SCPEs) that possess good safety, easy processability, and high ionic conductivity is of great significance for the development of advanced all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries (ASSLMBs). However, the poor interfacial compatibility between the electrode and solid electrolyte leads to a large interfacial impedance that weakens the electrochemical performance of the battery. Herein, an interpenetrating network polycarbonate (INPC)-based composite electrolyte is constructed via the in-situ polymerization of butyl acrylate, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide, succinonitrile and 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile on the base of a symmetric polycarbonate monomer. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of each component and the unique structure features, the INPC&LLZO-SCPE can effectively integrate the merits of the polymer and inorganic electrolytes and deliver superior ionic conductivity (3.56 × 10-4S cm-1 at 25 °C), an impressive Li+ transference number [t(Li+) = 0.52] and a high electrochemical stability window (up to 5.0 V vs. Li+/Li). Based on this, full batteries of LiFePO4/INPC&LLZO-SCPE/Li and LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/INPC&LLZO-SCPE/Li are assembled, which exhibit large initial capacities of 156.3 and 158.9 mAh g-1 and high capacity retention of 86.8% and 95.4% over 500 and 100 cycles at 0.2 and 0.1 C, respectively.

The viscoelastic responses of these bottlebrush copolymers within the linear viscoelastic (LVE) regime were carried out by the oscillatory shear rheology. The time-temperature superposition (tTs) principle was applied to construct the master curves of the dynamic moduli, and the sequential relaxation of dense bottlebrush copolymers with different PMMA hard outer block lengths was analyzed.

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "\n The internal stability of alluvial clays may be significantly compromised during a heavy rainfall due to infiltration of surface water causing sudden inundation, softening, and loss of erosion resistance or mechanical strength. Most of the available stabilization methods for clay soils employ pozzolanic or other cementitious binders, creating a chemically bound clay-admixture matrix. These admixtures commonly require a curing period after placement and compaction. Alternatively, aqueous polymers can be used in diluted form without any need for a curing period. Aqueous polymers can form agglomerations of clay particles enclosed in a matrix of polymer chains, held together by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding, improving erosion resistance. In this research, an aqueous polymer, namely, copolymer of butyl acrylate and styrene (CBAS), is mixed with alluvial clay sampled from Famagusta Bay, Cyprus, and the clay stability test is performed as a basis for assessing the degree of improvement on erosion resistance. A time-dependent approach for the evaluation of test results is followed to increase the accuracy of the analysis of the actual behavior observed during the test. A significant improvement in the erosion resistance is observed in treated test specimens. The mode of collapse of specimens during the clay soil stability test when aqueous polymer is used also changed from being gradual cracking and slaking to explosive. The swelling behavior and the effect of drying on the erosion resistance are also observed in the testing program. X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are performed for observation of the effect of CBAS on microstructural interactions, such as electrostatic bonding and changes in soil fabric.",

    "abstract": "A high‐temperature starved‐feed semi‐batch operating policy is developed to produce p(acrylates) with high macromonomer content, taking advantage of side reactions inherent to acrylate radical polymerization. This operating strategy results in significantly higher macromonomer content for the polymerization of isobornyl acrylate (iBoA) versus n‐butyl acrylate (BA) under identical operating conditions. This is because steric hindrance favors fragmentation (i.e., terminal double bond (TDB) formation) over addition (i.e., short‐chain or long‐chain branch formation), thus increasing the p(iBoA) TDB content and decreasing polymer dispersity. The p(iBoA) macromonomer solution serves as an excellent addition‐fragmentation agent to polymerize a second monomer in a single pot process controlled by sequential feeding, as demonstrated by the production of iBoA‐BA block and comb copolymer structures at different temperatures and macromonomer concentrations. The incorporation of the p(iBoA) macromonomer into a copolymer product is verified by various techniques, including polymer fractionation followed by TDB, composition, and molar mass analyses. Reaction temperature plays a key role in determining whether a blocky versus comb copolymer structure is produced. The ability to synthesize block and comb copolymers by radical polymerization without a mediating agent offers the potential to efficiently produce structured copolymers for industrial applications.This article is protected by copyright.

    "abstract": "Although F-containing molecules and macromolecules are often used in molecular biology to increase the binding with Lewis acidic groups by introducing favorable C-F dipoles, there is virtually no experimental evidence and limited understanding of the nature of these interactions, especially their role in synthetic polymeric materials. These studies elucidate the molecular origin of inter- and intra-chain interactions responsible for self-healing of F-containing copolymers composed of pentafluorostyrene and n-butyl acrylate units (p(PFS/nBA). Guided by dynamic surface oscillating force (SOF) and spectroscopic measurements supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these studies show that the reformation of σ-σ orbitals in -C-F of PFS and CH3CH2- of nBA units enables the recovery of entropic energy via flouorophilic-σ-lock van der Waals forces when PFS/nBA molar ratios are ~50/50. The strength of these interactions determined experimentally for self-healable PFS/nBA compositions is in the order ~0.3 kcal/mol which primarily comes from flouorophilic-σ-lock (~70%) contributions. These interactions are significantly diminished for non-self-healable counterparts. Strongly polarized -C-F σ orbitals create lateral dipolar forces enhancing the affinity towards -C-H orbitals, facilitating energetically favorable interactions.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The East Palestine, Ohio train derailment released toxic vinyl chloride (VC) and butyl acrylate (BA), which entered the watershed. Streambed sediment, surface water, and private well water samples were collected 128 and 276 days postaccident to assess the natural attenuation potential of VC and BA by quantifying biodegradation biomarker genes and conducting microcosm treatability studies. qPCR detected the aerobic VC degradation biomarkers etnC in ∼40% and etnE in ∼27% of sediments collected in both sampling campaigns in abundances reaching 105 gene copies g-1. The 16S rRNA genes of organohalide-respiring Dehalococcoides and Dehalogenimonas were, respectively, detected in 50 and 64% of sediment samples collected 128 days postaccident and in 63 and 88% of sediment samples collected 276 days postaccident, in abundances reaching 107 cells g-1. Elevated detection frequencies of VC degradation biomarker genes were measured immediately downstream of the accident site (i.e., Sulphur Run). Aerobic VC degradation occurred in all sediment microcosms and coincided with increases of etnC/etnE genes and Mycobacterium, a genus comprising aerobic VC degraders. The conversion of VC to ethene and an increased abundance of VC reductive dechlorination biomarker genes were observed in microcosms established with sediments collected from Sulphur Run. All anoxic microcosms rapidly degraded BA to innocuous products with intermediate formation of n-butanol and acrylate. The results indicate that microbiomes in the East Palestine watershed have natural attenuation capacity for VC and BA. Recommendations are made to improve first-response actions in future contaminant release accidents of this magnitude.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "A hydrogel is an ideal matrix material for flexible electronic devices, electronic skin and health detection devices due to its outstanding flexibility and stretchability. However, hydrogel-based flexible electronic devices swell once they are placed in a high humidity or underwater environment. The swelling behavior could damage the internal structure of hydrogels, ultimately leading to the reduction or complete loss of mechanical properties, electrical conductivity and sensing function. In order to resolve the above problems, a double network ionogel with remarkable anti-swelling behavior, stretchability and conductive properties was prepared. The ionogel consisted of gelatin (G) and copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), butyl acrylate (BA), dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate maleate (D) and N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBAA). Due to the dense crosslinking network and hydrophobic interaction, the ionogel exhibited remarkable anti-swelling properties (7.64% of the 30-day equilibrium swelling ratio in deionized water). D and MBAA were simultaneously introduced into the ionogel system as cross-linking agents to provide a large number of cross-linking points, improving the cross-linking density of the ionogel. Importantly, the introduction of D avoided ionic leakage by free radical copolymerization. Furthermore, the ionogel maintained stable mechanical properties and conductivity after being submerged in deionized water owing to remarkable anti-swelling performance. The mechanical properties of the ionogel retained 89.75% of the initial mechanical properties after a 5-day immersion in deionized water. Therefore, this ionogel could be employed as an underwater flexible wearable sensor for high humidity or underwater motion monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effect of the hydrophobicity of block copolymer macro-RAFT agents on the controllability of RAFT surfactant-free cationic emulsion polymerization of styrene was investigated. Three different copolymers, poly(dimethyl aminoethyl acrylate) (PDMAEA), poly(dimethyl aminoethyl acrylate-co-styrene)-b-(butyl acrylate) (P(DMAEA-co-St)-b-PBA) and poly(dimethyl aminoethyl acrylate-co-styrene)-b-(hexafluorobutyl acrylate) (P(DMAEA-co-St)-b-PHFBA), which had different hydrophobicity in their hydrophobic segments, were synthesized and used as the macro-RAFT agents. When P(DMAEA-co-St)-b-PHFBA and P(DMAEA-co-St)-b-PBA were used as macro-RAFT agents, the RAFT surfactant-free cationic emulsion polymerization of styrene underwent very fast. But when the PDMAEA was used as the macro-RAFT agent, no polymerization of styrene was observed. The controllability of styrene polymerization with P(DMAEA-co-St)-b-PHFBA as the RAFT agent showed much better than that with P(DMAEA-co-St)-b-PBA as the macro RAFT agent. This was ascribed to hydrophobicity difference of the hydrophobic segment between P(DMAEA-co-St)-b-PHFBA and P(DMAEA-co-St)-b-PBA macro-RAFT agents. A mechanism explanation for the controllability of emulsion polymerization was proposed. The location of the active trithiocarbonate group of the macro-RAFT agent in micelle was supposed to be a key factor affecting the controllability of RAFT surfactant-free cationic emulsion polymerization of styrene. The hydrophobicity of the RAFT agent and nature of medium had impact on the location of the active trithiocarbonate group of the macro-RAFT agent in micelle and affected the polymerization controllability.

    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this paper is devoted to application of the emulsion polymer of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) prepared with in situ nano-silica as a novel tanning agent of hide to partly or totally replace chrome salt and to improve physical, thermal and mechanical properties of the tanned leather and to reduce the environmental impact of chrome tanning effluent.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nPolymer/nano-silica hybrid emulsions were prepared via in situ seed emulsion polymerisation. The prepared polymers were characterised for solid content, molecular weight, viscosity, drying time, minimum film-forming temperature (MFFT) and microstructures (via transmission electron microscopy). The mechanical, thermal and surface morphological (by scanning electron microscope) properties of the treated samples were also investigated. The influences of the increase in the content of organic nano-silica on the properties of the tanned leather are discussed.\n\n\nFindings\nIt was found that the viscosity, the particle size and the solid content of the prepared polymers increased as the content of the nano-silica increased while gloss and drying time of the resulting polymer film decreased. Tanning buffalo hide by Polymer F (containing a high content of nano-silica) gave desirable properties in terms of tensile strength, thermal stability and shrinkage temperature.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis paper discusses the preparation and the characterisation of emulsion polymers with in situ nano-silica and their application in tanning process to enhance and improve the leather quality, as well as reduce the use of chrome tanning materials and consequently chrome tanning waste.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe tanned leather showed an improvement of physico-mechanical properties and enhancement of thermal stability. Furthermore, the tanned leather has uniform colour, softness and firmness of grain. All these promising results provide evidence to support the applicability of the prepared co-polymer/nano-silica emulsions as an efficient tanning agent that also provides lubricating properties for leather.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nSince May 2015, REACH Annex XVII restricts Cr(VI) in leather articles or leather parts of articles that come into contact with skin to a concentration of less than 3 mg/kg. Cases of discovery of Cr(VI) in leather papers have been reported by the European rapid alert system on dangerous consumer products (RAPEX). The emulsion poly (methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) with in situ nano-silica that has been developed via the study reported in this paper is one of the better technologies for the reduction of chromium ratio used in tanning industry.\n",

Glycosylated nanoparticles (glyco-NPs) of a poly(n-butyl acrylate) (pBA) core and poly(N-2-(β-d-glucosyloxy)ethyl acrylamide) (p(NβGlcEAM)) or poly(N-2-(β-D-galactosyloxy)ethyl acrylamide) (p(NβGalEAM)) corona were prepared via nanoprecipitation in aqueous solutions of preformed amphiphilic glycopolymers. Well-defined block copolymers of (poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) (pPFPA) and pBA were first prepared by RAFT polymerization followed by postpolymerization functionalization with aminoethyl glycosides to yield p(NβGlcEAM-b-BA) and p(NβGalEAM-b-BA), which were then used to form glyco-NPs (glucosylated and galactosylated NPs, Glc-NPs and Gal-NPs, respectively). The glyco-NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM. Encapsulation and release of ampicillin, leading to nanoparticles that we have termed \"glyconanobiotics\", were studied. The ampicillin-loaded glyco-NPs were found to induce aggregation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and resulted in antibacterial activity approaching that of ampicillin itself. This glyconanobiotics strategy represents a potential new approach for the delivery of antibiotics close to the surface of bacteria by promoting bacterial aggregation. Defined release in the proximity of the bacterial envelope may thus enhance antibacterial efficiency and potentially reduce the quantities of agent required for potency.",

By modulating the temperature to 30 °C, the volume of the polymer matrix is shrunk by 9 times, which allows the formation of physical shading and metabolism changing of the algae, and then triggers the functionality switching of the algae from photosynthetic oxygen production to hydrogen production. By contrast, by decreasing the temperature to 20 °C, the hybrid living materials go into a sol state where the algae behave normally with photosynthetic oxygen production. In particular, due to the proliferation of the algae in living materials, a long-term and exponential enhancement in the amount of hydrogen produced is achieved. Overall, it is anticipated that our investigations could provide a new paradigm for the development of polymer/living organism-based hybrid living materials with synergistic functionality boosting green biomanufacturing.",

    "doi": "10.1149/ma2025-02663166mtgabs",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one of the most pivotal technologies in searching for clean and sustainable hydrogen production. It has the ability to produce high-purity hydrogen at high current densities within a compact system design, which makes it a great promise as a solution for future hydrogen-based energy systems[1, 2]. Developing high-performing ionomers for electrode integration is crucial for optimizing the performance and long-term durability of PEMWE systems [3]. Currently, perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)--based ionomers are regarded as standard choices for electrochemical devices due to their chemical durability and excellent proton conductivity. However, their widespread use is limited on a daily basis for several key drawbacks, such as environmental concerns related to their fluorinated nature, high cost, and the possibility of degradation by reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals generated from hydrogen peroxide byproducts[4]. This PFSA limitation accelerated the search for alternative fluorine-free ionomers, such as hydrocarbon-based ionomer materials, which provide low cost, improved performance, and reduced environmental impact. Polyoxometalates (POMs), especially lacunary heteropolyacids (HPAs), are potential candidates for their strong proton mobility and ability to reduce chemical degradation through scavenging hydroxyl radicals[5]. However, HPA's usages are still limited due to their high water solubility, which, if improperly immobilized within a solid matrix, might lead to induced migration, clustering, or leaching.\n In response, this study investigates the synthesis of next-generation proton-conducting ionomers using polymer polyoxometalates (PolyPOMs). In order to create a stable hybrid ionomer matrix, a novel synthetic technique is employed in which a lacunary HPA—more precisely, 11-silicotungstic acid, a Keggin-structured POM—is covalently immobilized at maximal loading onto a polymer backbone and then copolymerized with an organic co-monomer. By efficiently immobilizing the ordinarily water-soluble POM inside the ionomer, this technique allows it to serve as a radical scavenger as well as a proton-conducting moiety. A higher concentration of HPA should theoretically improve proton transport and chemical degradation resistance against oxygenated radicals like •OH and •OOH without introducing the leaching problems often seen with mobile radical scavengers like cerium or manganese [6]. Additionally, the inclusion of the polymer backbone offers superior chemical and thermal stability, which qualifies the ionomer for the demanding water electrolysis operating conditions. This study primarily focuses on the synthesis, structural optimization, and assessment of its essential transport characteristics so that the synthesized ionomer can be incorporated into membranes and electrodes in PEMWE systems. A suite of different advanced analytical techniques is used to determine the structural integrity of the synthesized ionomers. A detailed understanding of the ionomer's molecular architecture and morphology is thoroughly obtained via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS), and Solid-State Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS NMR). Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the electrochemical performance of the produced ionomers will be investigated. This study seeks to identify key structure-property correlations that govern proton conductivity and stability. The findings will guide the logical design of advanced ionomers for PEMWE systems that meet the current and future operational and regulatory requirements.\n \n References:\n \n \n [1] G. A.

    "abstract": "Terpolymers of acrylonitrile with acrylic acid and alkyl acrylates, including methyl-, butyl-, 2-ethylhexyl-, and lauryl acrylates, were synthesized using the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer method. In this study, the focus was on the investigation of the impact of different monomer addition methods (continuous and batch) on both the rheological behavior of the spinning solutions and the mechanical properties of the resulting fibers. Our findings revealed that the method of monomer addition, leading either to non-uniform copolymers or to a uniform distribution, significantly influences the rheological properties of the concentrated solutions, surpassing the influence of the alkyl-acrylate nature alone. To determine the optimal spinning regime, we examined the morphology and mechanical properties at different stages of fiber spinning, considering spin-bond and orientation drawings. The fiber properties were found to be influenced by both the nature and introducing method of the alkyl-acrylate comonomer. Remarkably, the copolymer with methyl acrylate demonstrates the maximum drawing ratios and fiber tensile strength, reaching 1 GPa. Moreover, we discovered that continuous monomer addition allows for reaching the higher drawing ratios and superior fiber strength compared to the batch method.",

    "abstract": "An enzymatic electrochemical biosensor for urea detection was developed using the succinimide-modified aniline/n-butyl acrylate (nBA) conducting polymer. This aniline/nBA conducting polymer was synthesized by photopolymerization with the succinimide moiety incorporated during the photocuring procedure. The urease enzyme originating from Jack beans was chemically grafted on the succinimide-functionalized aniline/nBA conducting polymer, which was attached to a screen-printed carbon paste electrode (SPE). The enzymatic hydrolysis of urea by the urease electrode diminished the voltammetric biosensor response as a result of the cascaded chemical reaction between the enzymatically hydrolyzed hydroxide (OH-) ion and the K3Fe(CN)6 redox species that generating the side products (Fe(OH)3, CN- ion, and KCN), which impeded the electron transfer of the redox mediator at electrode-electrolyte interface. In view of the amount of side products produced was proportional to the urea concentration associated in the enzymatic reaction with the immobilized urease enzymes, this has allowed the proposed enzymatic biosensor to demonstrate an inverse sensitivity concept of detecting urea concentration in an ultrasensitive manner. The electron transfer rate constant (k) of the urease electrode based on aniline/nBA hybrid material at the electrode-electrolyte interface was determined at 5.374×10-5 cm s-1. The linear response range of the enzymatic urea biosensor was obtained from 1×10-10 mM to 1×10-1 mM (R2=0.9834) by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with a limit of detection of 4.72×10-11 mM at pH 5.0 and enzymatic hydrolysis time of 30 min. The voltammetric urea biosensor response showed good reproducibility with a promising relative standard deviation (RSD) acquired at 5.0% (n=9).

Hydrogels were synthesized by copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) and other acrylate comonomers onto the starch backbone. The hydrophilic agents 2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and acrylamide (AAm), as well as the hydrophobic butyl-methacrylate (BMA), were utilized as comonomers. Methylene-bisacrylamide (MBA) was employed as a crosslinking agent. The synthesized hydrogels were loaded with caffeine as a model drug. The effects of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the comonomers and chemical crosslinking on the swelling capacity and the release rate of caffeine were investigated. The use of the crosslinking agent and hydrophobic monomers decreased the swelling capacity of the hydrogels. The release rate of caffeine increased with the presence of a hydrophobic monomer. The fastest release was obtained with the AA/BMA/AAm formulation, and the slowest release was observed with the AA/HEMA/AAm formulation. The transport mechanism was controlled by Fickian diffusion in formulations containing AAm, and controlled by the polymer-relaxation mechanism in formulations containing MBA. Overall, our results showed that the swelling and drug delivery behavior can be tuned by varying the chemical composition of the copolymer formulations.

    "abstract": "Due to using gaseous fluorine monomer with toxicity, waterborne fluoropolymers are synthesized by semi-continuous high-pressure emulsion polymerization method which differs from free-pressure emulsion polymerization. To dates, the research on preparing process and kinetics for high-pressure emulsion polymerization is reported relatively less, which hinders researchers from understanding of mechanisms for monomer-fluorinated emulsion polymerization. The paper also provides a new method by element auxiliary analysis to calculate kinetics parameters of high-pressure emulsion polymerization. Based on aforementioned consideration, waterborne fluoropolymers were prepared by copolymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), vinyl acetate (VAc), butyl acrylate (BA) and vinyl ester of versatic acid (Veova 10) using potassium persulfate as initiator and mixed surfactants. The kinetics of emulsion polymerization of waterborne fluoropolymers was then investigated. Effects of emulsifier concentration, initiator concentration, and polymerization temperature on polymerization rate (Rp) were evaluated, and relationship was described as Rp∝[I]0.10 and Rp∝[E]0.12. The apparent activation energy was determined to be 33.61 kJ·mol-1. Moreover, the relative conversion rate of CTFE with the other monomers was observed, and results indicated that CTFE monomer more uniformly copolymerized with the other monomers. The resulting emulsion properties and pressure change in an autoclave were evaluated at different stirring rates. The initial reaction time, defined as the beginning time of dropwise addition, was determined by the change in solid content and particle size of emulsion.",

The disadvantage of vaccination is the use of pathogens (live or attenuated viruses and bacteria) that can lead to the development of a disease. Recombinant technologies are capable of producing specific DNA or protein molecules that possess antigenic properties and do not cause disease. However, individual antigen molecules are low-immunogenic, and therefore, require conjugation with a compound possessing stronger immunogenic properties. In this study, we examined the immunogenic properties of the new anionic copolymer consisting of glycidyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and acrylic acid, in mice. The experimental polymer induced a stronger immunogenic response than aluminum hydroxide. The histological studies have established that immunization both with aluminum hydroxide and the polymer studied does not cause damage to the liver, kidneys, or the spleen. No negative side effects were observed. It has been concluded that the new synthetic anionic polyelectrolyte hydrogel (PHG) has a potential as an adjuvant for vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of hollow latex particles through seeded emulsion polymerization involves a series of intricate steps, including the formation of distinct polymer layers with specific properties. Despite extensive research, preserving the desired hollow structure remains challenging due to the unclear role of the encapsulating polymer layers. This study systematically adjusts the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the intermediate layer by varying the butyl acrylate (BA) ratio in the monomer feed mixture. By controlling the reaction temperature during alkali swelling, we explore the critical influence of Tg on hollow latex particle formation from carboxylated core latex particles. To ensure long‐term hollow structure retention after drying, a rigid outer layer is polymerized onto the intermediate layer. Surprisingly, higher divinylbenzene (DVB) mass ratios (5.0 and 10.0 wt%) do not result in a highly crosslinked hollow shell due to DVB self‐nucleation. This paper emphasizes the importance of precise design parameters for both intermediate and outermost layers in achieving and maintaining hollow latex particle structures. Understanding each layer's role and optimizing their compositions contribute to advancing hollow latex particle synthesis through seeded emulsion polymerization.",

    "abstract": "Epoxy adhesives are widely used as structural adhesives distinguished by a significant degree of cross-linking, resulting in their brittle characteristics. Some specialized applications require improved thermal stability and adhesive strength. The incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles into a core–shell rubber (CSR) structure composed of poly(butyl acrylate-allyl methacrylate) core and poly(methyl methacrylate-glycidyl methacrylate) shell will enhance the adhesion, toughness, and thermal stability of epoxy adhesives. We synthesized CSR particles using a two-stage emulsion polymerization method, characterizing them through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. We synthesized epoxy adhesives with different CSR particles ratios (1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 phr) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (1, 2, and 5 phr) using mechanical stirring and ultrasonication (a two-step mixing process) to enhance dispersion. We cured the epoxy adhesive samples for 7 days for tensile tests and 2 days for lap shear tests at room temperature. We employed the tensile and lap shear tests to assess the mechanical properties of the samples. The samples underwent thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to assess their thermal stability. We assessed the fracture surface of the optimum samples using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). We utilized design-of-experiments (DOE) and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches to model the mechanical properties. The outcomes of FTIR, SEM, TEM and DCS analyses validated the successful synthesis of CSR particles. The tensile test findings on the dumbbell-shaped samples show a 51%, 30%, and 218% enhancement in tensile strength, modulus, and toughness for the samples containing 2.5 phr CSR particles and 2 phr zinc oxide nanoparticles, respectively. Furthermore, the lap shear tests revealed that the addition of 3.75 phr CSR particles and 5 phr zinc oxide nanoparticles increased the shear strength to 19.5 MPa. This is 127% higher than the pure epoxy. The TGA data indicated that both additions improved the thermal stability of the pure epoxy. Additionally, the predictions of shear strength, toughness, tensile modulus, and tensile strength by DOE and ANN were very close to the experimental results (R2adj > 0.95 for DOE and MREave < 3.2 for ANN).",

Nonetheless, butyl acrylate and 1-octen-3-one were both found to elicit a similar mushroom-like odour in previous studies. This led to the question of whether acrylates and enones with the same overall chain length generally elicited similar odours and whether they had similar odour thresholds. Overall, most of the investigated substances showed a mushroom-like, geranium-like or fruity odour. In contrast, short chained substances elicited garlic-like, lighter gas-like or glue-like, odour qualities, suggesting a correlation between the odour quality and the overall chain length. The results showed that only between the analogue structures butyl acrylate and 1-octen-3-one as well as hexyl acrylate and 1-decen-3-one could similar odour qualities be observed. All investigated substances showed low odour threshold values in air between 0.0032 ng/lair (1-hexen-3-one) and 55 ng/lair (1-dodecen-3-one). Overall, 1-alken-3-ones revealed a higher dependency on the chain length when compared to their respective acrylates. The introduction of a second terminal double bond led to a decrease of OT values in case of the acrylates and to an increase in case of the ketones that neither contained a second terminal double bond nor a double bond located close to the carbonyl group. Despite their structural similarities, the results suggest that both substance classes are perceived in a different manner and are therefore likely to be recognized by different types of receptors or are related to different activation patterns in multi-receptor stimulation processes.",

The morphology and the dynamic mechanical properties were examined at 0-5-10-15% ethylene-butyl-acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate (PTW) elastomer contents. The blends were crystallized for different time periods (0-20-40-60-180 s) at 150 °C and the morphology change during crystallization and its effect on impact resistance, stiffness, and thermal resistance were examined taking the three-phase model: crystalline fraction/mobile amorphous fraction/rigid amorphous fraction (CRF/MAF/RAF) into consideration. Based on DSC analyses it is proposed that before crystallization, the polymer chains covalently linked to PTW molecules contribute to the rigid amorphous phase (RAF). During thermal annealing, the relaxation of segments (which increases mobility) and ordering into crystals (which decreases mobility) have a complex effect and their resultant determines the ratio of the three phases and thereby also the macroscopic properties of the blends. After annealing the 15% PTW containing RPET blend at 150 °C for 180 s, a fivefold increase in notched impact resistance and a 50-fold increase in thermal resistance (expressed as E90’ value) were achieved compared to the neat RPET reference.",

Poly(triethylene glycol acrylate)-b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (P(TEGA)-b-P(tBA)) was synthesized by RAFT polymerization, with a DTM-functional acrylate monomer copolymerized into either the core forming P(tBA) block or the shell forming P(TEGA) block. Self-assembly by direct dissolution afforded spherical micelles with Rh of ca. 35 nm. Core-labeled micelles (CLMs) displayed bright emission (Φf = 17%) due to good protection of the fluorophore, whereas shell-labeled micelles (SLMs) had lower efficiency emission due to collisional quenching in the solvated corona. The transition from micelles to polymer unimers upon dilution could be detected by measuring the emission intensity of the solutions. For the core-labeled micelles, the fluorescence lifetime was also responsive to the supramolecular state, the lifetime being significantly longer for the micelles (τAv,I = 19 ns) than for the polymer unimers (τAv,I = 9 ns). The core-labeled micelles could also self-report on the presence of a fluorescent hydrophobic guest molecule (Nile Red) as a result of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the DTM fluorophore and the guest. The sensitivity of the DTM fluorophore to its environment therefore provides a simple handle to obtain detailed structural information for the labeled polymer micelles.

    "abstract": "N‐substituted maleimides polymerize in the presence of a radical initiator to give polymers with excellent thermal stabilities and transparency. In this study, we synthesized various maleimide copolymers with styrenes and acrylic monomers to control their thermal and mechanical properties by the introduction of bulky substituents and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Three‐component copolymers of N‐(2‐ethylhexyl)maleimide in combination with styrene, α‐methylstyrene (MSt), or 1‐methylenebenzocyclopentane (BC5) as the styrene derivatives, and n‐butyl acrylate, 2‐hydroxyethyl acrylate, 4‐hydroxybutyl acrylate, or acrylic acid as the acrylic monomers were prepared by radical copolymerization. These copolymers were revealed to exhibit excellent heat resistance by thermogravimetric analysis. Glass transition temperatures increased by the introduction of bulky MSt and BC5 repeating units. The mechanical properties of the copolymer films were improved by the introduction of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Optical properties, such as transmittance, refractive index, Abbe number, and birefringence, were determined for the copolymers. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Colloidosomes as Pickering emulsion microcapsules are expected to serve various applications, including encapsulation of drugs and loading of functional materials. Normally, when using colloidosomes for drug encapsulation, the latex particles as shell materials need to be mixed with drugs before the assembly process. However, this procedure may cause aggregation of latex particles, thereby resulting in disordered assembled shells or a low loading efficiency. Herein, we propose a three-fluid nozzle spray drying process to efficiently assemble latex particles of P(styrene (St)-co-butyl acrylate (BA)) into colloidosomes. The three-fluid nozzle spray drying equipment allows for the preparation for drug encapsulation without advance mixing of drug and shell materials. This strategy enables the construction of colloidosomes with uniform and controllable pores and the loading of functional materials. The effects of the compressed air flow rate, inlet temperature, feed rate, and solid content were explored, revealing the formation mechanism of colloidosomes during the spray drying process. Doxycycline hydrochloride (DH) was encapsulated in colloidosomes for controllable release, and the sustained release time is up to 100 h. The release rate can be adjusted by varying the glass transition temperature (Tg) and size of latex particles. Furthermore, Fe3O4 nanoparticle (NP)-loaded colloidosomes were constructed by this strategy. The magnetic response intensity of colloidosomes can be modulated by varying the amount of Fe3O4 NPs. The anticancer drug encapsulation and loading of other functional particles were also explored to expand applications.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Smart hinges fabricated using three-dimensional (3D) printing have been accepted in the aerospace, robotics, and biomedical fields since these devices possess a shape memory characteristic. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are the preferred materials for creating smart hinges due to their ability to achieve programmable complex geometries. However, fabricating SMPs with embedded components remains a challenge due to the constraints of current 3D printing methods and material limitations. This study investigated the use of a hybrid 3D printing method, direct ink writing (DIW), and embedded 3D printing (e-3DP) to print smart hinges with an embedded circuit to act as a strain sensor. The main components of the SMP included tert-Butyl acrylate (tBA) and aliphatic urethane diacrylate (AUD), but this SMP ink had a low viscosity and could not be used for DIW or e-3DP. Fumed silica (FS) was added to the SMP to tune its rheology, and it was shown that the FS concentration significantly affected the rheological properties, dry-out process, filament geometries, and self-supporting capabilities. This study presents a hybrid 3D printing approach for creating smart hinges with internal strain sensors in one step, demonstrating the versatility of DIW/e-3DP. The findings from this work provide a foundational and reliable technical solution to efficiently fabricate functional, self-monitoring, smart devices from SMPs for diverse applications.",

The results indicate that, under POSS aggregation via the fluorophilic/oleophilic co-monomer phase separation and owing to the low-surface-energy poly(perfluoropolyether)methacrylate incorporated into the copolymer, PFPEM–POSS exhibited a hierarchical micro-nano roughness in atomic force microscopy observations and provided the treated substrates with excellent hydrophobicity and abrasion resistance.

Results revealed that the copolymers exhibit a clear synergistic inhibitory effect on the growth of three seaweeds: Chlorella, Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros curvisetus, respectively, and three bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio coralliilyticus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, respectively. In addition, the copolymers exhibited excellent inhibition against barnacle larvae.

The polymer matrix has a naturally hydrophobic characteristic of n-butyl acrylate segment (n-BA) and cross-linkable and healable moiety from N-(hydroxymethyl) acrylamide segment (NMA). It was chosen due to the provisions of both a surrounding protective layer for inorganic perovskite and elastic, as well as healing ability to the whole organic-inorganic composite. This fabricated CsPbBr3/PBA-co-PNMA composite was demonstrated to stably persist against the suffering from hydrolysis of perovskites when exposed to a high moisture environment. The PL intensity of the composite after crosslinking was found to be relatively stable after 30 days of exposure to air. Upon water immersion, the PL intensity of composite only showed a decrease of 32% after the first 6 h, then remained stable for 6 h afterward. Furthermore, this fabricated composite was not only flexible and relatively transparent but also exhibited excellent self-healing capability in ambient conditions (T = 25°C), in which the self-healing efficiency after 24 h was above 40%. The tensile strength and stretching ability of 5 wt% perovskite content in the random copolymer were observed to be 3.8 MPa and 553.5% respectively.

The inflorescences of three Sorbus species (rowans), characterized by distinct molecular-genetic traits, were studied in order to examine the possible chemotaxonomic and antimicrobial value of their metabolites. GC–MS profiling of the hexane extracts of S. domestica, S. aucuparia, and S. torminalis inflorescences identified a total of 87 components, which represented six chemical classes (hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, fatty acid, aldehydes, and ketones) and miscellaneous minor floral constituents (1-methylinosine, 5-amino tetrazole, 1,4-dimethylbenzene, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-phenol, 3-acetoxy-7,8-epoxylanostan-11-ol, cycloeucalenol acetate, etc.). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity of the floral metabolites determined 1-hentetracontanol, nonacosane, pentadecyl acrylate, 1-methylhexacosane, cycloeucalenol acetate, butyl acetate, and urs-12-ene as the main components which contributed to the differences between S. domestica, S. aucuparia and S. torminalis and resulted in the distinction between the rowan species. Disc-diffusion assays showed variability in activity of inflorescence extracts against Gram-negative (Enterobacter dissolvens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Gram-positive (Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis) bacterial and clinical fungal (Candida albicans) strains. The effect of S. torminalis was high against S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, while it was at its lowest against clinical C. albicans strains. Inflorescences of S. domestica showed the highest inhibition of P. aeruginosa, and moderate effects against S. epidermidis and C. albicans. Inflorescences of S. aucuparia caused low to moderate growth inhibition of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, while it showed the highest effect on C. albicans. Antimicrobial properties of rowan inflorescences may be attributed to oleic, linoleic, arachidic, hexadecanoic, and pentadecanoic acids, 24-norursa-3,12-diene, hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, cycloeucalenol acetate, and other compounds which have known bioactivity. These findings indicated rowan inflorescences as a rich source of valuable secondary metabolites and allow us to assume an application of the floral constituents as chemotaxonomic markers of the genus Sorbus species.",

Herein, we describe a systematic approach to studying the structure–property relationships for a series of 3D printable elastomers from commonly used monomers and crosslinkers, including n‐butyl acrylate (BA) and 2‐hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA). Polymer samples showed elongations‐to‐break between 200%–400% and Young's moduli between 0.4–0.6 MPa. The study helps to develop a picture of the chemical space inhabited by these model systems via permeability experiments and relation to Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs). The permeability of the tested solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), pyridine, isopropanol (IPA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was related to the composition and increased water uptake of the materials. As the weight percent of HEA increased in the polymer composition, the permeability of all solvents increased. The magnitude of the permeability depended on solvent interactions with water, quantified by HSPs, and was independent of polymer composition. THF exhibited the highest permeability through the polymer membranes due to its low HSP.

This paper demonstrates versatile synthetic systems of micelle‐crosslinked hydrogels with highly stretchable, self‐healing, and selectively adhesive properties. For this, methacrylate‐bearing random copolymer micelles are designed as physical and covalent crosslink domains via the self‐assembly of amphiphilic random copolymers carrying hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), hydrophobic butyl or dodecyl groups, and methacrylate‐terminal PEG in water. The size, aggregation number, and pendant methacrylate number of the micelles are controlled by the composition and degree of polymerization. Hydrogels are efficiently obtained from the free radical polymerization of hydrophilic monomers such as PEG acrylate and acrylamide in the presence of the micelle crosslinkers in water. Owing to the dynamic yet selective chain exchange properties of the micelle domains, the hydrogels are highly stretchable up to over 1000% and show self‐healing and selectively adhesive properties. The self‐healing of hydrogels is promoted upon heating due to the fast chain exchange of the micelle domains, whereas hydrogels consisting of micelles with different alkyl groups are never adhesive because of their self‐sorting properties.",

Experiments were performed in the range of the broad melting range of the actuators at 40 °C The degradation of test specimen was monitored by the sample mass, which was reduced by 25 wt% within 105 d.

The cleavage of ester groups included in OCL segments resulted in a decrease of the melting temperature (T_m) related to the actuator domains (amorphous at the temperature of degradation) and simultaneously, the T_m associated to the skeleton domain was increased (semi-crystalline at the temperature of degradation). The alkaline hydrolysis decreased the polymer chain orientation of OCL domains until a random alignment of crystalline domains was obtained. This result was confirmed by cyclic thermomechanical actuation tests. The performance of directed movements decreased almost linearly as function of degradation time resulting in the loss of functionality when the orientation of polymer chains disappeared. Here, actuators were able to provide reversible movements until 91 d when the accelerated bulk degradation procedure using alkaline hydrolysis (pH = 13) was applied. Accordingly, a lifetime of more than one year can be guaranteed under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4) when, e.g., artificial muscles for biomimetic robots as potential application for these kind of shape-memory polymer actuators will be addressed.",

More precisely, vitrimers derived from commodity polymers could have a drastic impact on plastic consumption in the upcoming years. Here, the development of a polystyrene-based vitrimer harnessing the recently discovered hemiacetal ester exchange reaction of carboxylic acid is presented. 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol divinyl ether was reacted with 4-vinylbenzoic acid to form a divinyl species containing two hemiacetal ester functions. This dimer was then copolymerized with styrene, butyl acrylate and 4-vinylbenzoic acid to form a cross-linked material presenting pendent acid groups. This material exhibited three distinct behaviors at different temperature regimes: below 80 °C, despite the ability of exchange reactions to occur, the cross-linked material behaved as a frozen material due to hydrogen bonding formed by carboxylic acid pendent groups. Between 80 °C and 130 °C vitrimer behavior was demonstrated by rheological creep experiments. At higher temperature, the dissociation of the hemiacetal ester groups led to the loss of the covalent cross-linking.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The interfacial instability of Na metal anodes poses a significant barrier to the practical applications of sodium metal batteries. According to electric double layer (EDL) theory, the potential difference in the Helmholtz layer critically affects electrochemical reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, which governs the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition and the Na deposition process. Herein, we leverage the electric dipole effect of polymers, formed via in situ polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA), which preferentially adsorbs on the Na metal surface, to modulate the conformation of the EDL. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that poly-BA facilitates the formation of a more compressed diffuse layer and reduces the potential difference in the Helmholtz layer. This compressed EDL with the change of species derives homogeneous SEI, enabling reversible Na plating/stripping. As a result, the poly-BA quasi-solid electrolyte extends the lifespan of the Na||Na cell to 3500 hours at 0.1 mA cm-2. Quasi-solid-state Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cells maintain stable cycling over 1500 cycles, with a capacity retention of 87.6% at 5 C. Our findings indicate that modulating the EDL structure via the electric dipole effect of polymers enables uniform Na deposition, offering a promising strategy for designing electrolytes for practical quasi-solid-state sodium metal batteries.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Mechanically robust and anisotropic conductive hydrogels have emerged as crucial components in the field of flexible electronic devices, since they possess high mechanical properties and intelligent sensing capabilities. However, the hydrogels often swell on exposure to aqueous medium because of their hydrophilicity, which compromises their mechanical properties. Additionally, the hydrogels' isotropic polymeric networks demonstrate isotropic ion transport, which significantly diminishes the sensing capabilities of electrical devices based on hydrogels. These factors greatly limit their use in flexible and wearable sensors. In this study, we have developed poly(acrylamide-co-maleic acid-co-butyl acrylate) based anisotropic hydrogels by prestretching and drying, followed by ionic cross-linking to fix the alignment. The anisotropic arrangement of the polymer network resulted in significant improvements in mechanical performance and electrical conductivity along the prestretching direction. This anisotropic hydrogel combines hydrophobic and metal ion-ligand interactions, enhancing the maximum tensile strength up to 11 MPa along the prestretching direction, about 3 times higher than in the perpendicular direction. The optimized 200% prestretched hydrogel exhibited high tensile strength (7 MPa), flexibility (fracture strain 370%), high toughness (16 MJ m-3) and antiswelling behavior in water (equilibrium swelling ratio 2% after 15 days). alongside higher conductivity (3 times higher) and strain sensing ability (4 times higher gauge factor) along the prestretching direction. The hydrogel demonstrated efficient and stable underwater sensing for underwater communication and to monitor human limb position and movement. The anisotropic hydrogel electrolyte-based flexible supercapacitor exhibited 117 Fg-1 specific capacitance at 0.5 Ag-1, and maximum energy density 5.85 Whkg-1, significantly higher than the corresponding values for the isotropic hydrogel-based device (88 F g-1 and 4.4 Whkg-1, respectively). This hydrogel mimics the structural design of unidirectionally oriented muscle fibers, showing better direction dependent functional properties than the corresponding isotropic hydrogel. The anti-swelling ability and retention of mechanical and conductive properties of these hydrogels in aqueous environment suggest long-term usage capability of these functional materials.",

Thus, CRT can help to suppress gelation in the synthesis of densely grafted poly(n-butyl acrylate) molecular bottlebrushes using the “grafting-from” method by decreasing the fraction of chains terminated by conventional bimolecular radical combination. Molecular bottlebrushes by ATRP are typically prepared slowly in low yield and to limited monomer conversion to prevent radical combination, cross-linking, and gelation.

It was found that the PCL-b-PtBA can self-assemble into various morphologies including lozenges, quadrilaterals, elongated hexagons, hexagonal platelets, saw blade platelets and spindle micelles. Additionally, transmission electron microscopes (TEM) imaging indicated a gradual morphological transformation from quadrilateral to lozenge platelets, and then to elongated-hexagon platelets with high aspect ratios as the sampling time was prolonged. We hypothesize that variations in polymer composition lead to changes in the self-assembly morphology primarily due to differences in the reduced tethering density of PtBA segments with varying chain lengths, which subsequently impacts the crystallization of PCL. Our work reveals that adjusting block ratios of the PCL-contained block copolymer for self-assembly is a facile way to construct diverse morphologies of polymer materials, and the corresponding materials may have potential applications in fields such as drug delivery, antibacterial treatments and other fields.",

This strategy afforded well-defined bottlebrush polymers with molar masses in excess of 11 000 kg/mol. For un-cross-linked bottlebrush polymers, 180° peel tests revealed a cohesive failure mode and showed similar peel strengths (∼30 g/mm) regardless of the backbone polymer degree of polymerization (DP). The bottlebrush polymers were then treated with butylamine to remove the trithiocarbonate, liberating thiols on each side-chain terminus. In the presence of oxygen, these thiols readily cross-linked via disulfide bond formation. The cross-linked bottlebrush polymers with a backbone DP of 400 showed a greater than sixfold improvement in peel strength, whereas those with a backbone DP of 100 exhibited a twofold enhancement compared with un-cross-linked samples along with a change to adhesive failure.

The characterisation of the prepared emulsions was performed using Fourier transform infrared, thermo-gravimetric analysis, gel permeation chromatography and transmission electron microscopy. A selection of co-polymers and ter-polymers were formulated with pigments and additional ingredients, as water-based flexographic inks. The inks were characterised for their rheological properties, pH, degree of dispersion, water-resistance and colour density.\n\n\nFindings\nIt was found that the low viscosity of the prepared polymers may reduce the film thickness of the flexographic inks and may also increase the spreading of the ink on the surface. As a result, stable modified poly acrylate-based latex with improved physico-mechanical properties was obtained. The prepared latexes showed improved properties such as enhanced thermal stability and better water resistance. The effect of the emulsifier type on the properties of the resulting emulsion latexes and their corresponding films were investigated. Also, as the hydrophobic monomer increases, so does the colour density and increasing the binder ratio enhances the gloss values. The improving in gloss values were obtained and provide excellent adhesion properties for both the pigment particles and the base paper.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe study focusses on the preparation of new water-based ter-polymer nano-particles and their use as eco-friendly binders for flexographic ink industry.

The Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) absorption band of GNRDs with an aspect ratio of 3.9 (length/diameter) was located at 820 nm after surface grafting with block copolymers showing a hydrodynamic diameter of 160 nm at 37 °C. On the other hand, the stability of the P(DEGMA-co-OEGMA)-b-PNIPAAm@GNRDs and P(DEGMA-co-OEGMA)-b-P(NIPAAm-co-BA)@GNRDs nanohybrids was monitored for 8 days; where the LSPR absorption band did not shift or show any broadening. Aqueous dispersed nanohybrids were irradiated with a near-infrared laser (300 mW), where the temperature of the surroundings increased 16 °C after 16 min, where conditions for no precipitation were determined. These tailored temperature-responsive nanohybrids represent interesting candidates to develop drug nanocarriers for photo-thermal therapies.",

There are various reports on the use of sustainable materials in the synthesis of polymer resins, but research on the use of sustainable materials in development of coating additives such as polymeric dispersant is significantly lacking. Objective of this work is to produce fatty acid‐based polymeric dispersant using oleic acid in combination with butyl acrylate. The performance of the fatty acid‐based polymeric dispersant was benchmarked against commercially available and petrochemical‐based polymeric dispersant. The dispersants produced were characterized using spectroscopies (1H‐NMR and FTIR), thermal analyses (thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry), and molecular weight analysis. Application test was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the polymeric dispersant in titania pigment concentrate formulation which was tinted in nitrocellulose clear coating. Properties such as viscosity, fineness, gloss, optical properties, and storage stability were evaluated, and the result obtained shows that fatty acid‐based polymeric dispersant could disperse titania efficiently and produced coatings with good optical properties and excellent gloss retention. The carboxyl group from the incorporated fatty acid served as excellent pigment anchoring group, facilitating good orientation of dispersant on the pigment surface and promote excellent stability.",

The solubility and diffusion of tBA with EVA containing 7, 20, and 40 wt.% vinyl acetate (VA) and with LDPE in the temperature range 20–75 °C were studied by optical micro-interferometry method.

The concentration dependences of the interdiffusion coefficients as well as dependences of the self-diffusion coefficients on VA content and on temperature were plotted. The activation energy of self-diffusion of EVA and LDPE was calculated. It was shown that the most promising tBA modifier is EVA-40, which is completely soluble at all studied temperature ranges.

Because of its low storage modulus (2.4 × 104 Pa), a mixture of soft polyurethane acrylate, butyl acrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate was used to fabricate a PSA. The in-plane and through-plane thermal conductivity of the gr-PSA film were measured as 1.56 (±0.37) Wm−1K−1 and 0.25 (±0.03) Wm−1K−1, respectively. The peeling behavior of the gr-PSA tape was investigated by a 90° peel test and the results were compared with simulation results obtained by cohesive zone modeling implemented in the finite element method.

While short‐chain branching for poly(t‐BuAAm) samples could not be detected by 13C NMR, the reduced rate of monomer conversion with lowered monomer content indicates the formation of mid‐chain radicals (MCR) by backbiting. Adding water as a cosolvent to ethanol significantly increases reaction rates, in agreement with recent pulsed‐laser studies that quantify the influence of solvent composition on homopropagation kinetics. However, the measured drifts in comonomer composition with conversion are well represented by a single pair of reactivity ratios (rMA = 1.12 ± 0.01, rt‐BuAAm = 0.71 ± 0.01) over the complete range of experimental conditions. A mechanistic model developed to describe t‐BuAAm homopolymerization is extended to capture the impact of reaction operating conditions (monomer content and composition, solvent composition, initiator content, and temperature) on the features of t‐BuAAm/MA copolymerization, thus providing a tool for product and process optimization.

PLimC is made from orange waste‐derived limonene oxide (LimO) and CO2. The brittle behavior of PLimC remains a challenge for industrial applications. A possible solution could be the introduction of low Tg polymer grafts. The terpolymerization of trans‐LimO, trans‐menth‐1‐ene oxide (Men1O), and CO2 was shown to yield a terpolymer that can be used as a platform for controlled functionalization and tailored graft copolymerization. To transform the terpolymer into a macroinitiator for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), the PLimC double bonds were post‐modified with hydroxyl groups via thiol‐ene click reaction of 2‐mercaptoethanol and subsequently esterified with 2‐bromoisobutyryl bromide (BiB). n‐Butyl acrylate (nBA) was chosen as a bio‐based monomer for grafting‐from copolymerization to introduce low Tg side chains that increase the ductility of the otherwise brittle PLimC. Matrix‐assisted laser desorption ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF MS) was used to show the narrow molecular weight distribution of the side chains. Non‐wovens made from PMen1C‐g‐PnBA were produced via electrospinning. PMen1C‐g‐PnBA was added as a compatibilizer for blends of PLimC and poly(n‐butyl acrylate) (PnBA) and as a toughening agent for PLimC.Practical Applications: PMen1C‐g‐PnBA shows tunable mechanical properties by variation of PnBA content and graft density. Poly(limonene carbonate)’s brittle nature could be compensated by addition of PMen1C‐g‐PnBA, therefore opening up many possible industrial applications for PLimC to replace common fossil‐based plastics.

    "abstract": "AbstractFree radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylates is under conventional lab‐scale batch conditions characterized by strong nonisothermicity. Hence, side reactions with a high activation energy such as β‐scission are highly relevant already at intermediate temperatures (313–333 K), broadening the log‐molar mass distribution and decreasing the average molar masses. To avoid thermal runaway, one can design jacket temperature profiles or exploit semibatch reactor operations. Model‐based design with stochastic solvers is a strong tool to support the identification of optimal reactor settings although rarely applied upon mutually addressing reactor temperature changes and concentration variations due to (multicomponent) feeding strategies. Here such coupled design is performed for lab‐scale solution FRP of n‐butyl acrylate, benefiting from i) many inputted kinetic parameters (e.g., Arrhenius parameters) that have been benchmarked based on individual experimental techniques, ii) previous kinetic Monte Carlo validation under batch nonisothermal conditions including a prediction of reactor temperature extrema; and iii) systematic screening of semibatch operations in combination with flat and stepwise (average) jacket temperature profiles. It is demonstrated that many molecular properties are safely within hand for different total batch times, taking 2,2′‐azobis(2‐methylpropionitrile) as initiator.

    "abstract": "A one-pass continuous flow strategy to form block copolymer nanoaggregates directly from monomers is presented. A key development towards such a sophisticated continuous flow setup is a significant improvement in continuous flow dialysis. Often impurities or solvent residues from polymerizations must be removed before block extensions or nanoaggregate formation can be carried out, typically disrupting the workflow. Hence, inline purification systems are required for fully continuous operation and eventual high throughput operation. An inline dialysis purification system is developed and exemplified for amphiphilic block copolymer synthesis from thermal and photoiniferter reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The inline dialysis system is found to be significantly faster than conventional batch dialysis and the kinetics are found to be very predictable with a diffusion velocity coefficient of 4.1 × 10−4 s−1. This is at least 4–5 times faster than conventional dialysis. Moreover, the newly developed setup uses only 57 mL of solvent for purification per gram of polymer, again reducing the required amount by almost an order of magnitude compared to conventional methods. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) or butyl acrylate (BA) was polymerized in a traditional flow reactor as the first block via RAFT polymerization, followed by a ‘dialysis loop’, which contains a custom-built inline dialysis device. Clearance of residual monomers is monitored via in-line NMR. The purified reaction mixture can then be chain extended in a second reactor stage to obtain block copolymers using poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) as the second monomer. In the last step, nano-objects are created, again from flow processes. The process is highly tuneable, showing for the chosen model system a variation in nanoaggregate size from 34 nm to 188 nm.",

Lichtenstein tension-free mesh repair is a commonly performed surgery for hernia. Various studies have revealed atraumatic fixation of the mesh produces less pain without compromising the outcomes. Methods: This is a prospective analytical study conducted in a tertiary hospital over a year. Eighty patients with primary inguinal hernia undergoing open mesh repair were enrolled and divided into two groups with 40 patients in each group. Mesh fixation was done with N-butyl 2 cyano-acrylate glue in one group, while polypropylene 2-0 suture in the other group. Postoperative pain, the number of dosages of analgesia required, the incidence of hematoma/seroma formation, surgical site infection, and length of hospital stay were compared between the two groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25. Results: Visual analog scores were significantly reduced in the glue group at 12 h and 24 h (P<0.05) with a reduction of the mean number of analgesic doses from 6.42±0.984 in the suture group to 5.95±0.597 in the glue group (P<0.05). The operating time was significantly reduced from 70.03±4.376 minutes in the suture group to 58.43±4.540 min in the glue group (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay. Five percent of cases in the suture group developed seroma while no SSI was reported in this study. Conclusions: This study demonstrates mesh fixation with cyanoacrylate glue in open hernioplasty for primary groin hernias is associated with reduced immediate postoperative pain, dose of analgesia required, and operating time in comparison to fixation with suture.",

The method of coupled thermally induced self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) platelets within a polymer matrix and in situ chemical reduction of GO was applied. The synthesized hydrogels were dried using the ambient pressure drying (APD) and freeze-drying (FD) methods. The effects of the weight fraction of rGO in the composites and the drying method on the textural, morphological, thermal, and rheological properties were examined for the dried samples. The obtained results indicate that APD leads to the formation of non-porous xerogels (X) of high bulk density (D), while FD results in the formation of highly porous aerogels (A) with low D. An increase in the weight fraction of rGO in the composite xerogels leads to an increase in D, specific surface area (SA), pore volume (Vp), average pore diameter (dp), and porosity (P). With an increase in the weight fraction of rGO in A-composites, the D values increase while the values of SP, Vp, dp, and P decrease. Thermo-degradation (TD) of both X and A composites takes place through three distinct steps: dehydration, decomposition of residual oxygen functional group, and polymer chain degradation. The thermal stabilities (TS) of the X-composites and X-rGO are higher than those of the A-composites and A-rGO.

Polymer shells of the particles were obtained by copolymerization of methyl methacrylate with several acrylate comonomers: butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, propyl acrylate, and ethyl acrylate. The photonic crystal films with the highest sensitivity to ethanol vapors were obtained on the basis of the core/shell particles synthesized by semi-batch emulsion polymerization. It was also established that introducing butyl acrylate or propyl acrylate units into shell copolymers led to an increase in the sensitivity of the resulting photonic crystal films. The films demonstrated a pronounced thermosensitivity only when the corresponding core/shell particles were synthesized as follows: the shell comonomers (methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate) were introduced into the reaction system during the semi-batch emulsion process in a single step.

In this process, we investigated the effect of the alkyl side chain lengths of hydrophobic acrylic monomers on the glistening of hydrophobic acrylic IOL materials. As the content of hydrophobic acrylic monomers (BA, EHA, and DA) increased, the glistening of IOL materials decreased significantly for all hydrophobic acrylic monomers. At the same content of hydrophobic acrylic monomers, the IOL material showed the least content of glistening when copolymerized with DA.

At the interface, the terpolymer tends to form isolated circular micelles composed of hydrophobic PnBA cores and hydrophilic PNIPAM‐PDMAEA coronas. The limiting areas in the surface pressure–molecular area isotherms under acidic and alkaline conditions are larger than that under neutral conditions due to the larger interfacial stretching degrees of PNIPAM blocks, which results from the strong electrostatic repulsions of the fully protonated PDMAEA blocks underwater in the acidic case. In our minds, the hysteresis degrees of the compression−expansion cycles under different subphase pH conditions should mainly depend on the initial stretching degrees of the hydrophilic blocks. Under acidic conditions, the isotherms shift toward small areas with the increase of temperature due to the increased solubility of PNIPAM blocks.

Their use in free-radical polymerizations (FRPs) is still limited due to the low propagation rate coefficients resulting in low polymerization rates and the occurrence of depropagation which is responsible for limited monomer conversion. Since FRP is considered very robust with few requirements concerning monomer purity, it is still interesting to investigate how itaconate FRP may become feasible. For this reason, copolymerizations of itaconates with other monomers well-suited for FRP are considered. In particular, copolymerization with acrylates appears to be interesting because the propagation rate of these monomers is high and depropagation is not operative at common polymerization temperatures. Copolymerizations of dibutyl and dicyclohexyl itaconate with butyl acrylate were performed to determine the copolymerization reactivity ratios required for tailoring copolymer composition. To limit the number of experiments, copolymerizations were carried out until high conversion and consumption of the individual monomers was obtained from 1H NMR spectroscopy and quantitative size-exclusion chromatography.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "The structures of amphiphilic block and gradient copolymers in solution and adsorbed onto surfaces are surveyed using molecular-dynamics simulations. A bead-spring model is used to identify the general effects of the different architectures: block and gradient copolymers have equal numbers of solvophilic and solvophobic beads, and the gradient copolymer is represented by a linear concentration profile along the chain. Each type of isolated copolymer forms a structure with a globular head of solvophobic beads, and a coil-like tail of solvophilic beads. The radius of gyration of a gradient copolymer is found to be much more sensitive to temperature than that of a block copolymer due to an unravelling mechanism. At finite concentrations, both gradient and block copolymers self-assemble into micelles, with the gradient copolymers again showing a larger temperature dependence. The micelles are characterised using simulated scattering profiles, which compare favourably to existing experimental data. The adsorption of copolymers onto structureless surfaces is modelled with an attractive potential that is selective for the solvophobic beads, and the surface structures are characterised using the average height of the molecules, and the proportion of beads adsorbed. Both types of copolymer form adsorbed films with persistent micelle-like structures, but the gradient copolymers show a stronger dependence on the strength of the surface interactions and the temperature. Coarse-grained, bead-spring models allow a rapid survey and comparison of the block and gradient architectures, and the results set the scene for future work with atomistic simulations. A superficial but favourable comparison is made between the results from the bead-spring models, and atomistic simulations of a butyl prop-2-enoate/prop-2-enoic acid (butyl acrylate/acrylic acid) copolymer in n-dodecane at room temperature.",

Triblock copolymers with identical PnBA midblocks and varying lengths of PMMA end-blocks were synthesized from a spiropyran-containing macroinitiatior via atom transfer radical polymerization, yielding polymers with volume fractions of PMMA ranging from 0.21 to 0.50. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the polymers self-assembled into spherical and cylindrical nanostructures. Simultaneous tensile tests and optical measurements revealed that mechanochemical activation is strongly correlated to the chemical composition and morphologies of the triblock copolymers. As the glassy (PMMA) block content is increased, the overall activation increases, and the onset of activation occurs at lower strain but higher stress, which agrees with predictions from our previous computational work. These results suggest that the self-assembly of nanostructured morphologies can play an important role in controlling mechanochemical activation in polymeric materials and provide insights into how polymer composition and morphology impact molecular-scale force distributions.",

The molecular weights of the obtained PBA are not varied obviously with the conversion, but the molecular weight distributions are narrow. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) studies reveal three polymerization mechanisms. The TPPT can efficiently capture the growing PBA radicals to form PBA-TPPT• radicals, and this highly stable radicals are able to be cross-terminated by the growing PBA• radicals or primary radicals to form the dormant chains. Although the reversed reaction of reaction 1 is very slow, the extension polymerization of the PBA can undergo to form block copolymers.

Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize hyperelastic adhesives (HEAs), by designating hyperelasticity and adhesiveness to the bulk and the surface of a polymer network, respectively. The bulk is hyperelastic but nonadhesive, and the surface is viscoelastic but adhesive, while the HEA is hyperelastic and adhesive. We exemplify the principle by synthesizing poly(butyl acrylate) as the bulk and poly(butyl acrylate-co-isobornyl acrylate) as the surface. The resulting HEA exhibits a low hysteresis of 4% at 100% strain and an adhesion energy of 270 J m-2. Moreover, the HEA is optically transparent, thermally stable, spontaneously adhesive to various materials, and mechanically stable against cyclic load, relaxation, and creep. We demonstrate two applications enabled by the unique combination of hyperelasticity and adhesiveness. The proposed strategy is generic, paving new avenues for stretchable yet resilient adhesives for diverse applications.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The effect of the hydrophobicity of the core part and salt on the temperature responsiveness of polymeric micelles composed of sulfobetaine and hydrophobic blocks was investigated. Poly(sulfopropyl dimethylammonium propylacrylamide) (PSPP) was used as the sulfobetaine; poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) (PEHA), poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA), poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA), or poly(n-hexyl acrylate) (PnHA) was used as the hydrophobic polymer. Measurement of the transmittance revealed that the transition temperature of the sulfobetaine homopolymer could be controlled by adjusting the concentration, the degree of polymerization (DP), and the concentration of the added salt. The effect of the anionic species of the added salt due to the chemical structural properties of the sulfobetaine chain was consistent with the order of ionic species with strong structural destruction in the Hofmeister series. The temperature response and micelle formation behavior of the polymeric micelles according to the hydrophobicity of the core part and the preparation method were examined by static light scattering (SLS), fluorescence measurement with pyrene, dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmittance, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Micelles that had EHA (solubility in water was 0.01 g/100 mL) as the core and did not show temperature responsiveness expressed temperature responsiveness at a lower hydrophobicity (solubility of nBA in water was 0.14 g/100 mL). nBA-b-SPP did not show temperature responsiveness due to the block ratio. However, when micelles were prepared by dialysis, smaller and more stable micelles could be formed in an equilibrium state, and temperature responsiveness was observed. Their transition temperature can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of the sulfobetaine blocks, the hydrophobicity of the core part, the concentration of the polymer aqueous solution, and the concentration of the added salt. Furthermore, like the sulfobetaine homopolymer, the effect depended on the anionic species of the added salt.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of gamma irradiation on acrylate‐based shape memory polymers (SMPs) when combined with various crosslinkers.

The photo‐initiation process utilized 2,2 dimethoxy‐2‐phenylacetophenone (DMPA), followed by gamma radiation crosslinking at absorbed doses ranging from 5 to 300 kGy. The degree of gelation depended on the copolymer composition and irradiation dose, with poly(IBoA‐nBuA)‐BPAEDA exhibiting the highest gelation degree (99%) and poly(IBoA‐nBuA)‐TMPTA showing the lowest (86%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the copolymer structure, while thermal stability was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Dynamic mechanical analysis analysis of the copolymers revealed significant variations in mechanical properties based on the type of crosslinker, radiation dose, and copolymer composition. Furthermore, the shape memory behavior of the copolymers was examined, demonstrating temperature‐dependent storage and loss moduli for crosslinked poly(IBoA‐nBuA) copolymers at a radiation dose of 150 kGy. In summary, the findings highlight that gamma irradiation crosslinking and the choice of crosslinkers have a substantial impact on the properties of acrylate‐based SMPs.",

Butyl acrylate/vinyl acetate (BA/VAc) copolymer formulations incorporating varying amounts of 2‐methylene‐1,3‐dioxepane (MDO) monomer are subjected to a 60‐day composting process, with their biodegradation monitored via CO2 emissions. The MDO is added to the formulation to provide ester bonds in the polymer backbone to promote their hydrolysis and facilitate the breakdown of the polymer into smaller fragments. A lab‐made composting setup based on the ASTM D5338 standard is used to provide continuous monitoring of environmental conditions and CO2 emissions to track biodegradation. The highest 60‐day biodegradation observed is 12.49% for a sample containing ~9 mol% MDO. This contrasted with BA/VAc samples without MDO, which have zero biodegradation. Biodegradation is influenced by the amount of ester groups (i.e., ring‐opened MDO content), as well as the polymer gel content. An additional experiment with carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (cCNCs) in the BA/MDO/VAc formulation is shown to promote even greater biodegradation due to the increased hydrophilicity and improved microbial access provided by the cCNCs. Overall, this study demonstrates that MDO‐based formulations, especially those incorporating cCNCs, show promise as environmentally friendly, compostable products in support of a more sustainable polymer industry.",

Since 2014, the Commission uses an empirical approach to set MAK values for substances with critical effects on the upper respiratory tract or the eyes. Based on this approach, the equivalent concentration at the workplace is 1.5 ml/m\n            3\n            . However, studies in humans to investigate the sensory irritation of n‐butyl acrylate are lacking. As the structurally related ethyl acrylate possesses a RD\n            50\n            value as well as subchronic and chronic NOAECs similar to those of n‐butyl acrylate, the NOAEC of 2.5 ml ethyl acrylate/m\n            3\n            for sensory irritation in volunteers was used as a read‐across. As the MAK value for ethyl acrylate has been set at 2 ml/m\n            3\n            , the MAK value of 2 ml/m\n            3\n            for n‐butyl acrylate could be confirmed. In analogy to ethyl acrylate, the assignment of n‐butyl acrylate to Peak Limitation Category I and the excursion factor of 2 were confirmed. The NOAECs for developmental toxicity in rats and mice are sufficiently high so that there is no reason to fear damage to the embryo or foetus when the MAK value is observed. Thus, n‐butyl acrylate continues to be classified in Pregnancy Risk Group C. The substance is marginally clastogenic in vitro but not in vivo after inhalative exposure and was not carcinogenic in a 2‐year inhalation study in rats. There are only a few cases of contact sensitization in humans but there are positive results in local lymph node assays. Data on airway sensitization are still not available. n‐Butyl acrylate continues to be designated with “Sh”. Skin absorption was calculated to contribute significantly to the systemic toxicity and n‐butyl acrylate is designated with an “H”.",

    "abstract": "Photonic crystal coatings with unique structural colors and self-cleaning properties have been providing an efficient way for substrate coloration. However, the enhancement of the robustness and durability of structural colored coatings to meet the requirements in diverse environments remains a challenging task. Here, to realize the application of photonic crystal films under various kinds of conditions, we present a poly(fluoroalkyl acrylate)-based colloidal photonic crystal (fCPC) coating. Fluorinated core-interlayer-shell (FCIS) colloidal particles of polystyrene (PS) core, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) interlayer, and poly(fluoroalkyl acrylate-ethyl acrylate-butyl acrylate) (P(FA-EA-BA)) shell copolymers have been first prepared by a stepwise emulsion polymerization. fCPCs with self-supporting property, reprocessing ability, friction resistance, as well as excellent wettability and liquid-repellent properties are successfully obtained via the bending-induced ordering technique (BIOT). When applied in antifouling applications, the fCPC film exhibits resistance against various oil and inorganic liquids. Furthermore, the fCPC coatings demonstrate their durability under outdoor conditions by maintaining stable color appearances during rainy and sunny conditions. Additionally, an electronic product adhered with the fCPC coatings is presented, which exhibits a surface that remains clean even after prolonged usage in comparison to the conventional CPC coating. Structural colored textiles with enhanced stability and functionalized liquid-repellent properties are achieved through a one-step process using FCIS particles. Therefore, the developed self-cleaning and comprehensive fCPC coatings capable of withstanding diverse conditions may open up new avenues for the advancement of structural coloration in decoration, vehicle, textile, and building.",

    "abstract": "Pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are widely used materials, yet most of their raw materials are currently derived from nonrenewable petroleum resources. The PSA industry faces challenges including the depletion of petroleum resources, high solvent emissions, and carbon-intensive manufacturing processes. To address these issues, a series of poly(dibutyl itaconate-co-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PDBAG) copolymers were synthesized via high-temperature semicontinuous emulsion polymerization, using fully biobased dibutyl itaconate (DBI) as a monomer. The structures and properties of PDBAG with varying DBI and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) contents were systematically characterized. An optimal balance between adhesion and cohesion was achieved at a GMA content of 0.5 wt %. Remarkably, increasing DBI content from 30 wt % to 50 wt % enhances the high-frequency shear loss modulus (G″) from 55.5 to 87.3 kPa (measured at T = 40 °C, ε = 1%) and correspondingly improves the 180° peel strength with SUS from 10.7 N/25 mm to 16.5 N/25 mm. This enhancement mechanism is attributed to increased energy dissipation within the PSA network during peel deformation. They surpass commercial acrylic PSAs in both peel strength and shear holding power. Biobased PSA partially replaces petroleum-based acrylics in the polymer backbone and features simpler, more eco-friendly processing while maintaining outstanding adhesion. This establishes a sustainable pathway for next-generation adhesive development.",

However, weak intermolecular interaction within the plant oil-based polymeric materials usually gives rise to poor mechanical properties. Herein, the mechanical properties of polymeric materials can be enhanced through dynamic supramolecular hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) interaction by mixing thymine-modified-cellulose (Cell-T) or cellulose-grafted-poly(4-((3-(thymin-l-yl)propanoyl)oxy)butyl acrylate) (Cell-g-PTAc) with plant oil-based copolymers containing complementary nucleobase moieties. The polymeric materials containing Cell-g-PTAc and plant oil-based copolymers with adenine have moderate mechanical properties due to the weak interaction between complementary nucleobases as elucidated by DSC and FT-IR analyses. Compared with bottlebrush copolymers Cell-g-PTAcs, the linear polymer Cell-T achieves a stronger and more efficient H-bonding interaction within the polymeric network (15.4 MPa over 1.8 MPa in tensile strength). Additionally, the rigid backbone of cellulose and residual cellulose hydroxyl group induced covalent crosslinking also play an important role in improving the mechanical properties, compared with the flexible backbone one with the same nucleobase.

Herein, the amphiphilic oligomeric radical with hydrophobic P(St-co-BA) chains and hydrophilic sulfate groups ([−OSO3]−) from water-soluble potassium persulfate could migrate to surface of primary latex particles to act as an emulsifier when amount of the additional emulsifier is so low, which causes an imbalance between inside and outside osmotic pressures of the latex particles to result in bowl-shaped particles for the kinetic stability.

    "abstract": "In response to the current problem that micron-scale plugging agents cannot effectively plug shale nanopores and fractures, tetrameric poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) nanoparticles were synthesized by the Michael addition reaction using sodium vinyl sulfonate, styrene, butyl methacrylate, and butyl acrylate as raw materials. The nanoparticles poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, particle size analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. The particle size distribution of poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) at room temperature ranged from 62.17 to 96.44 nm, with a median particle size of 75.8 nm, and could withstand high temperature of 359.5 °C. The effects of poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) on the rheological parameters of drilling fluid and the effects of different temperatures on the median particle size were investigated by the drilling fluid performance testing methods and high-temperature stability testing methods. The results showed that the apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity, yield point, and high temperature and high pressure water loss of drilling fluid gradually decreased with the increase in poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) dosage; when the addition of poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) was 2.0%, the overall performance of drilling fluid was better, the filtration loss was 4.4 mL, and the drilling fluid had good water loss wall building performance. The median particle size of poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) was 132.60 nm (the particle size at room temperature was 75.8 nm) after standing for 16 h at 180 °C, indicating that poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) has good high-temperature stability and dispersion stability. The plugging performance and plugging mechanism of poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) under extreme conditions (high temperature) were investigated by the plugging performance test method and pressure transfer method. The results showed that the plugging rate of artificial mud cake and artificial core reached 48.18 and 88.75%, respectively, when the amount of poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) was added at 2.0%. In the pressure-transfer experiments, poly(VS-St-BMA)-BA) could invade the 2 mm position of the nanopore fracture on the core surface and form a sealing barrier layer to prevent the further invasion of liquid. Combined with the pressure-transfer experiment, it shows that poly(VS-St-BMA-BA) can enter the nanopore and fracture at a certain distance under the action of formation pressure and keep accumulating to form a tight blockage, which can effectively prevent the filtrate from entering the nanopore fracture of the shale formation.

It is particularly desirable to switch adhesion without using additives and chemical agents. In this article, we explore the potential of altering bottlebrush network architecture, via a mild external stimulus, to induce shifts in the viscoelastic properties of a material. Specifically, we controllably decrease the cross-link density of a bottlebrush network via exposure to UV light over a short period of time, leading to quantitatively predictable shifts in the network's plateau modulus and Rouse relaxation time. This was achieved through the incorporation of o-nitrobenzyl ester groups into the cross-links of a poly(n-butyl acrylate) brush network, which cleave in response to UV light. Concurrently enhancing softness and dissipation allowed enhancement of the work of adhesion by more than 3 orders of magnitude for peel rates ranging from ca. 10-3 to 10 s-1.

The immobilized Hb on the poly(nBA)-rGO conducting matrix exhibited electrocatalytic ability for the reduction of nitrite with significant enhancement in the reduction peak at −0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode.

In RAFT emulsion polymerization, the surface density of the polymer stabilizer decreases with the growth of latex particles, which results in a decrease in particle stability and the aggregation of particles. Therefore, a major challenge in RAFT emulsion polymerization is to improve the stability of the synthesized particles. Herein, an approach to improving particle stability in the seeded emulsion polymerization process is reported. Seed latex particles with poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) shells and poly(methyl acrylate) cores are prepared through RAFT emulsion polymerization. Initiated by bromine groups at PDMA chain ends, zwitterionic poly(3-dimethyl(methacryloyloxyethyl)-ammonium propanesulfonate) (PDMAPS) blocks are synthesized on the seeds by in situ activator generated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization. The seed particles are employed in the subsequent RAFT seeded emulsion polymerization of n-butyl acrylate. Experimental results demonstrate particle stability in the polymerization process.

The results show that PEO/PMA blends are miscible as suggested by the number of Tg values that follow the Fox equation and the development of homogeneous mixtures in the molten state (T = 80 °C). On the other hand, PEO/PnBMA blends are immiscible as shown by the constancy of the Tg values of PEO throughout the blend compositions. The immiscibility was confirmed by optical microscopy which shows the matrix‐droplet and co‐continuous morphologies (i.e. heterogeneous mixtures) in the PEO/PnBMA blends at T = 80 °C. Melt rheological properties of the immiscible PEO/PnBMA blends are affected by the blend compositions and show significant deviation from Maxwell behaviour. Conversely, the rheological properties of the miscible PEO/PMA blends show close to Maxwell behaviour. Hence, the correlation of thermal, morphological and melt rheological studies is discussed for both miscible and immiscible PEO/polyacrylate blends. © 2023 Society of Industrial Chemistry.",

    "doi": "10.1122/8.0000576",
    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Recently, a simple strategy was developed for preparing interconnected interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) based on butyl rubber (IIR) and poly( n-octadecyl acrylate) (PC18A). Solvent-free UV polymerization of n-octadecyl acrylate (C18A) monomer in the melt of IIR at ambient temperature resulted in IPNs with self-healing and shape-memory functions. Here, we demonstrate that the use of IIR grafted with acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and 10-undecenoic acid instead of unmodified IIR provides a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of IPNs. Differential scanning calorimetry, small-angle x-ray scattering, and wide-angle x-ray scattering analysis reveal side-by-side packing of C18 side chains of PC18A to form lamellar crystals with a melting temperature Tm between 46 and 52 °C. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicates the existence of quasispherical nanoparticles composed of crystalline domains, which are dispersed in a continuous interpenetrating rubber-PC18A matrix. This microstructure provides them a complete self-recovery behavior induced by heating and an efficient shape-memory function. IPNs exhibit around tenfold higher chemical cross-link density as compared to those prepared from the native IIR, reflecting the effect of pendant vinyl groups on the extent of covalent interconnections between the IIR and PC18A components. The type of the grafted monomers significantly affects the mechanical performance of IPNs, which can be explained with the individual contributions of chemical and physical cross-links to the total cross-link density. The amount of the grafted rubbers in IPN could be further increased up to 80 wt. % by the incorporation of toluene into the reaction system, resulting in IPNs with a wide range of tunable thermal and mechanical properties.",

The core material of ENPCM was n-octadecane and the shell materials were polymethyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate and polymethyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate-hydroxyethyl methacrylate. Subsequently, the synthesized ENPCMs were applied onto bamboo fabric by the dip and dry method. The properties of ENPCMs were analyzed in terms of surface morphology, size distribution and latent heat; the treated bamboo fabrics were evaluated in terms of surface morphology, hydrophilicity, washing fastness and heat storage capacity. The results showed that polymethyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate/n-octadecane (PMBO) microcapsules had an irregular shape, while polymethyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate-hydroxyethyl methacrylate/n-octadecane (PMBHO) microcapsules were spherical, and the mean diameters of both microcapsules were less than 1 µm. The latent heat of phase change material (PCM) microcapsules was almost the same at a thermal storage capacity of 110 J/g. There were many more and more even PMBHO microcapsules deposited on bamboo fabric than that of PMBO microcapsules deposited on bamboo fabric. Bamboo fabrics treated by both microcapsules were hydrophilic, and the hydrophilicity of fabric treated by PMBHO microcapsules was even better. The ratio of PCM microcapsules to bamboo fabric was about 1:4, and the latent heat of treated bamboo fabrics was about 20 J/g. Moreover, the treated bamboo fabrics exhibited excellent washing fastness due to the strong binding strength between the highly hydrophilic microcapsules and bamboo fibers.

Unlike conventional single‐polymer systems, this multifunctional terpolymer provides synergistic reinforcement by integrating hydrophobic, hydroxyl, and carboxyl functionalities. The polymer was added at 0%–0.750% by cement weight. Mechanical testing and multi‐scale analyses (FT‐IR, XRD, SEM, 1H‐NMR) revealed a remarkable 94% increase in flexural strength at 0.750% polymer, attributed to interpenetrating polymer networks bridging micro‐defects and distributing stress uniformly. Compressive strength peaked at 0.125% due to microstructural densification but declined at higher dosages because of polymer‐induced porosity. These findings demonstrate a tunable balance between strength and toughness, positioning PMMA‐co‐PHEA‐co‐PAA as a next‐generation polymer additive for crack‐resistant, flexible cementitious materials.",

    "abstract": "Bulk copolymerization of alkyl acrylates and cyclodextrin (CD) host monomers produced a single movable cross-network (SC). The CD units acted as movable crosslinking points in the obtained SC elastomer. Introducing movable crosslinks into a poly(ethyl acrylate/butyl acrylate) copolymer resulted in good toughness (Gf) and stress dispersion. Here, to improve the Young’s modulus (E) and Gf of movable cross-network elastomers, the bulk copolymerization of liquid alkyl acrylate monomer swelling in SC gave another type of movable cross-network elastomer with penetrating polymers (SCPs). Moreover, the bulk copolymerization of alkyl acrylate and the CD monomer in the presence of SC resulted in dual cross-network (DC) elastomers. The Gf of the DC elastomer with a suitable weight % (wt%) of the secondary movable cross-network polymer was higher than those of the SCP or SC elastomers. The combination of suitable hydrophobicity and glass transition of the secondary network was important for improving Gf. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated that the DC elastomers exhibited heterogeneity at the nanoscale. The DC elastomers showed a significantly broader relaxation time distribution than the SC and SCP elastomers. Thus, the nanoscale heterogeneity and broader relaxation time distribution were important to increase Gf. This method to fabricate SCP and DC elastomers with penetrating polymers would be applicable to improve the Gf of conventional polymeric materials. The “molecular knitting method” improves toughness and Young’s modulus. We prepared dual cross-network (DC) elastomers with a knitting structure and single movable cross-network elastomers with penetrating polymers (SCP elastomers) by swelling the single movable cross-network (SC) elastomers in liquid monomers. The DC elastomers showed a high toughness and a high Young’s modulus. SAXS indicated that the DC elastomers exhibited heterogeneity at the nanoscale.

    "year": 2017,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACTCationic photopolymerization has become increasingly important in thin‐film applications for advantages including no oxygen inhibition and rapid polymerization rates. Photocurable cationic thin film properties are often modulated by incorporation of oligomeric and prepolymer materials, but little work has directly examined the effect of prepolymer structure and reactive group placement on the thermomechanical properties of the final material. To explore the role of molecular architecture, epoxy functionalized butyl acrylate gradient copolymers were synthesized with reactive groups in end segments or randomly distributed along the prepolymer chain. Polymerized end functionalized formulations exhibit moduli almost double that of random functionalized oligomer formulations. In addition, inclusion of end functionalized prepolymers decreases creep of resulting thin films by a factor of 10. Furthermore, decreasing the concentration of the cross‐linking diluent in end functionalized prepolymer systems results in amorphous networks with significantly lower mechanical strength. Increasing reactive groups at the ends of prepolymers produces stronger materials without affecting tensile elongation at break. These properties indicate that the structured oligomers facilitate the formation of continuous hard domains with high cross‐link density with inclusions of soft, flexible domains of low cross‐link density. This study demonstrates that the prepolymer architecture governs network formation and ultimate properties. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem.2017,55, 144–154",

The temperature dependence of the effective interaction parameter χeff between n-butyl acrylate (BA) and the average monomer of the MMA-r-S random block was evaluated from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis using the random phase approximation (RPA) approach. The calculated χeff, as a function of the styrene fraction in the random copolymer block, shows a good agreement with the mean-field binary interaction model. This consistency indicates that the effective interaction between component BA and the average monomer of the random copolymer block is smaller than the interactions between pure components (χBA,MMA,χBA,S). The present study suggests that the introduction of a random copolymer block to a block copolymer can effectively reduce the degree of incompatibility of the block copolymer system without altering the constituent species, which may serve as a viable methodology in designing novel thermoplastic elastomers based on triblock or multiblock copolymers.",

Zatloukal, “Frame-invariant formulation of novel generalized Newtonian fluid constitutive equation for polymer melts,” Phys. Fluids 32(9), 091705 (2020)] has been modified to provide uniaxial extensional viscosity at a high strain rate limit corresponding to molecular expression for a fully extended Fraenkel chain reported in Ianniruberto et al. [“Melts of linear polymers in fast flows,” Macromolecules 53(13), 5023–5033 (2020)]. It uses basic rheological and molecular parameters together with the ratio of monomeric friction coefficients for equilibrium and fully aligned chains. The modified GNF model was successfully tested by using steady-state uniaxial extensional viscosity data for well-characterized entangled polymer melts and solutions [namely, linear isotactic polypropylenes, poly(n-butyl acrylate), polyisoprenes, and polystyrenes] covering a wide range of strain rates, including those, at which the chain stretch occurs. Only two fitting parameters were sufficient to describe all uniaxial extensional viscosity data, one related to the Rouse stretch time and the other controlling the extensional thinning and thickening behavior at medium and high strain rates. The model was compared to five different advanced viscoelastic constitutive equations, which are based on Doi–Edwards theory and include chain stretch along with a number of important additions. The ability of the proposed GNF model to represent steady uniaxial extensional viscosities under fast flow conditions for entangled polymer fluids has been shown to be superior to the predictions of selected advanced viscoelastic constitutive equations. It is believed that the modified GNF model can be used in the stable modeling of non-Newtonian polymer liquids, especially in very fast steady-state flows where chain stretch begins to occur.",

Nano-sized lignin is rising as a class of sustainable nanomaterials that can be incorporated into latex colloids. Fundamental knowledge of the correlation between surface chemistry of lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) and integration efficiency in latex colloids and from it thermally processed latex films are scarce. Here, an approach to integrate self-assembled nanospheres of allylated lignin as the surface-activated cores in a seeded free-radical emulsion copolymerization of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate is proposed. The interfacial-modulating function on allylated LNPs regulates the emulsion polymerization and it successfully produces a multi-energy dissipative latex film structure containing a lignin-dominated core (16% dry weight basis). At an optimized allyl-terminated surface functionality of 1.04 mmol g-1 , the LNPs-integrated latex film exhibits extremely high toughness value above 57.7 MJ m-3 . With multiple morphological and microstructural characterizations, the well-ordered packing of latex colloids under the nanoconfinement of LNPs in the latex films is revealed. It is concluded that the surface chemistry metrics of colloidal cores in terms of the abundance of polymerization-modulating anchors and their accessibility have a delicate control over the structural evolution of core-shell latex colloids.",

    "abstract": "Curcumin is a natural extract from the plant curcuma longa and part of turmeric, a spice and herbal remedy in traditional medicine. Thousands of papers claim a plethora of health benefits by curcumin, but a growing number of reports and contributions caution that many experimental data may be artifacts or outright deny any suitability of curcumin due to its problematic physicochemical properties. Two major issues often encountered with curcumin is its extraordinary low solubility in water and its limited chemical stability. Here, we report on a novel nanoformulation of curcumin that enables curcumin concentrations in water of at least 50 g/L with relative drug loadings of more than 50 wt.%. Despite this high loading and concentration, the curcumin nanoformulation comprises polymer-drug aggregates with a size less than 50 nm. Most interestingly, this is achieved using an amphiphilic block copolymer, that by itself does not form micelles due to its limited hydrophilic/lipophilic contrast. The ultra-high loaded nanoformulations exhibit a very good stability, reproducibility and redispersibility. We compared the cytotoxicity of the curcumin loaded nanoformulation with simple DMSO based solution using the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and found that the cancer cells are more resistant in 3D culture and require higher concentrations. Because of limited stability, the DMSO solution of CUR proved problematic at the high concentrations needed in the 3D culture. This may reflect the situation in vivo more correctly and offers a rationale that the presented ultra-high curcumin loaded nanoformulation may be considered a tool to harness the full therapeutic potential of curcumin. Introduction For many years, high-throughput screenings have been seen as a game changer for the discovery of lead molecules for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). However, when it comes to the development of a dosage form, one major challenge, the formulation of the API, remains. An estimated 40% – 60% of all NCEs (new chemical entities) developed in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical industry are practically insoluble in water. In addition, 90% of all marketed APIs in today’s drug delivery pipelines are reported to be poorly water-soluble. This poses a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. 5 Obviously, the demand for excipients which increase the water solubility and thus, the bioavailability of hydrophobic compounds is enormous. Naturally, amphiphilic compounds are of paramount interest in this context. First thoughts of using polymeric micelles for medicinal applications were already reviewed in the early 1980s by Ringsdorf and coworkers. Polymeric micelles are nanoscopic, typically core/shell structures formed by amphiphilic block copolymers. Both, the inherent and modifiable properties of polymeric micelles make them particularly well suited for formulation purposes. Several polymeric micellar formulations are currently undergoing preclinical, phase I, phase II , and phase III clinical trials, which have shown improved antitumor efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity. Poly(2-oxazoline)s (POx) are currently intensively discussed as a promising and highly versatile class of biomaterials. 15 Hydrophilic and amphiphilic POx have been reported to exhibit a high cytocompatibility, easy modulation of solubility and size, architecture as well as chemical functionality. Although their synthesis was already reported in the mid1960s, it took almost 30 years until first attempts towards POx-based systems for nonfouling surfaces and drug delivery systems were explored. Block copolymers of poly(2oxazoline)s (POx) are accessible via living cationic ring-opening polymerization (LCROP) of 5 membered cyclic imino ethers (2-oxazolines) (Figure 1a). The combination of LCROP of 2-oxazolines with other types of polymerization can further increase the structural variety of the polymer amphiphiles. In 2015, Zhao et al utilized pH-responsive polymeric micelles based on poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-poly(D,L-lactide) (pEtOx-PLA) prepared by combining LCROP with anionic ring-opening polymerization for co-delivery of the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor in a targeted and controlled manner. In addition, attaching polyethylenimine (PEI) onto pEtOx-PLA micelles enabled the co-delivery of minicircle DNA vectors and doxorubicin achieving cell internalization resulting in effective gene expression and anti-tumoral activity. However, also pure POx based micelles have shown excellent formulation abilities. Luxenhofer et al. utilized polymeric micelles based on amphiphilic ABA triblock-copolymers to solubilize paclitaxel (PTX), which is characterized by an extremely low aqueous solubility (logP = 3.70 – 3.96; solubility (H2O) = 0.4 μg/mL). The investigated amphiphile comprised of two hydrophilic poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (pMeOx) blocks A and a modestly hydrophobic poly(2-butyl-2-oxazoline) (pBuOx) block B (Figure 1b) exhibited high loading capacities of almost 50 wt% PTX as well as a high water solubility of the resulting formulation, corresponding to an increase of solubility of PTX over five orders of magnitude to 50 g/L. 37 In vivo studies revealed superior antitumor efficacy of the obtained POx/PTX nanoformulations compared to commercially available formulations Taxol® or Abraxane® with maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of 150 mg/kg (c.f. 20 mg/kg for Taxol® and 90 mg/kg for Abraxane®, respectively). Schulz et al. and Seo et al. explored the interplay of POx and drug structure on the solubilization behavior and micellar morphology and found marked polymer/drug specificities. In these reports, the POx side chain was varied. However, changes in the polymer main chain may also be used to tailor polymer-drug compatibility. Poly(2-oxazine)s (POzi) can be formally derived from poly(2-oxazoline)s (POx) by shifting a methylene group from the polymer side chain to the polymer main chain. Although similar in chemical structure, POzi have been much less investigated than POx. Similar to POx, POzi can be obtained via living cationic ring-opening polymerization (LCROP) employing 6membered 2-substituted 2-oxazine (IUPAC: 2-R-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-oxazine) monomers instead of 2-substituted 2-oxazolines (IUPAC: 2-R-4,5 dihydrooxazole) (Figure 1a). 43 Thus, POzi and POx offer an interesting macromolecular design space via side chain and main chain variation, which cannot be realized in the same way by acrylate or vinyl based polymers. Figure 1. a) Schematic synthesis of the structural isomers poly(2-oxazoline)s (POx) and poly(2-oxazine)s (POzi) by living cationic ring opening polymerization (LCROP) of 2-substituted 2-oxazolines (IUPAC: 2-R-4,5-dihydrooxazole) and 2substituted 2-oxazines (IUPAC: 2-R-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-oxazines); b) schematic representation of the amphiphilic triblock copolymers investigated in the present study. Very recently, Lübtow et al. reported that the structural variation between POx and POzi can have a major effect with respect to drug formulation. Pronounced drug/polymer specificities with regard to the solubilization capacity for PTX and curcumin (CUR), were observed. While being the most effective solubilizer for paclitaxel, the triblock-copolymer bearing a moderately hydrophobic poly(2-butyl-2-oxazoline) (A-pBuOx-A) core was least effective in solubilizing curcumin. In contrast, its structural isomer bearing a poly(2-propyl-2-oxazine) core (A-pPrOziA, Figure 1b) exhibited excellent solubilization for CUR even though this polymer is even less hydrophobic. CUR (log P = 3.28, solubility (H2O) = 0.6 μg/mL) is a natural yellow phenolic compound which is present in many kind of herbs, particularly in Curcuma longa (turmeric). It is a bisα,β-unsaturated β-diketone which exhibits keto-enol tautomerism (Figure 2). Figure 2. Physical appearance and chemical structure of curcumin showing the keto-enol tautomers of diferuloylmethane. Although a vast number of preclinical and clinical studies pointed out the antioxidant, cardioprotective, neuroprotective , antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory 54 and antitumor activities of curcumin (and its related curcuminoids as well as its natural analogues), the “generally regarded as safe” compound has not been approved as a drug for human use. However, as Baell and Walters pointed out, “some of the compounds that should ring the most warning bells are toxoflavin and polyhydroxylated natural phytochemicals such as curcumin [...]”. So called pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) can interfere with assays, making them appear to be active even if they are not. It is argued that eventually, these promising compounds are condemned to fail, sometimes only in late stage clinical trials. However, this critical viewpoint is not unchallenged. A reason for the many activities of CUR is that it may function as a reactive chemical rather than a specific binder for, e.g. a certain protein. On the one hand, CUR is claimed to modulate various signaling molecules (interleukin-1β; cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin E2, NF-κB; etc.) making it a non-discriminating substance rather than a monotargeted therapeutic (taking into account that CUR degradation products might also display biological properties ). On the other hand, the chemical reactivity causes rapid metabolism in vivo which in combination with its extreme low water solubility drastically reduces its bioavailability. A plethora of studies to increase the bioavailability of curcumin can be found in the literature, starting with the addition of simple adjuvants like piperine, however, only with modest success. More sophisticated approaches include the use of nanotechnology, but most CUR nanoformulations suffer from mediocre drug loading (approx. 10 – 20 wt%) 69 and low overall solubility (0.3 g/L (loading capacity (LC) = 13 wt.%, loading efficiency (LE) = 96%; 0.4 g/L (LC = 17 wt.%); 41 mg/L (LC = 12%, LE = 83%); 0.22 g/L (LC = 5.2%, LE ≈ 55%)).",

    "abstract": "Potential applications of colloidal polymer nanoparticles in the preparation of smart inks are investigated by physical incorporation of the oxazolidine molecules. Precise adjusting the polymer chain flexibility and polarity is achieved by controlling the ratio of methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate monomers in the polymerization reaction. In addition, nanofibrous indicators of acid-base vapors are prepared from the latex nanoparticles. This can be beneficial for creating materials that sense and respond to environmental changes, such as humidity or moisture and acidity. Thermochromic inks are prepared by microencapsulating crystal violet lactone dye (CVL) in polymer matrices to prevent their release into the aqueous media. Combining two distinct systems with varying triggers, such as light and temperature, provides an effective strategy for double-encryption anticounterfeiting and crack and scratch detection and indication applications. Preparing labels impregnated with double-responsive inks, a novel approach is developed for food spoilage detection and preservation indication. Labels are manufactured using polymer nanoparticles, which contain photoluminescent oxazolidine molecules, as well as a trinary mixture of CVL within core-shell latex particles as the thermochromic dye. The combination of these two responsive elements transforms traditional packaging into a dynamic and interactive sentinel for the food it holds.",

    "abstract": "Organic-based thermoelectric materials have become increasingly popular for their ability to convert waste heat into electricity, coupled with their low processing costs, mechanical flexibility, and non-toxicity, making them an attractive option for wearable electronics. However, there is a lack of direct integration of intrinsically stretchable semiconducting polymers in wearable thermoelectric devices. This study investigates the potential of using poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(butyl acrylate) (P3HT-b-PBA) copolymers doped with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) to develop stretchable thermoelectric devices. Two PBA block lengths, with number molecular weights (M\n                     n) of 3,000 and 6,000, were compared to pristine P3HT homopolymer. We found that all films exhibited edge-on orientations before and after doping, as determined by GIWAXS analysis. The lamellar distance increases while the π − π stacking distance decreases upon doping, indicating that the dopants preferentially allocate in the side-chain domain. Accordingly, the optimized power factor (PF) of the doped P3HT-b-PBA3k and P3HT-b-PBA6k films are found to be 2.13 and 1.42 μW m−1 K−2, respectively; and the stretchable thermoelectric device comprising P3HT-b-PBA3k and a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrate demonstrate good stretchability with a high PF of 1.77 μW m−1 K−2 at 50% strain, and a high PF retention 86.3% relative PF after 200 stretch/release cycles. This outstanding performance highlights the feasibility of fabricating stretchable thermoelectric device by using intrinsically stretchable semiconducting polymer. The study presents a promising approach for creating stretchable thermoelectric devices using conjugated/insulating block copolymers combining the thermoelectric properties of P3HT and the intrinsic softness of PBA.",

    "abstract": "Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have generally become potential candidates for energy storage devices because of their high energy density. However, the practical applications of LMBs have been limited due to the low safety of liquid electrolytes. Compared to liquid electrolytes, solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have excellent mechanical strength. However, there is room for improvement because traditional PEO-based SPEs need more mechanical properties and electrode contacts for flexible energy device applications. Self-healing solid polymer electrolytes (SHSPEs) have excellent flexibility and healing ability and can also suppress dendrite formation to increase the safety of LMBs. In this study, a novel SHSPE is designed by a combination of the zwitterionic copolymer, SBMA ([2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide)-co-BA (Butyl Acrylate), and a lithium salt, LiTFSI. We explored their solvation structures and reactivity on the Li metal anode using Density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods. Besides, we also studied the reactivity of the considered SHSPE on the Cu (100) surface to explore the SEI formation mechanisms. The cationic NR4\n + and anionic SO3\n - groups of SBMA interact electrostatically and form cross-linked network structures within the electrolyte framework, providing the designed SHSPE with prominent self-healing capacity. The decomposition reactions of SHSPE on the Li metal anode are explored, and the resultant decomposition products that contribute to the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are identified. Furthermore, AIMD results indicate that highly concentrated SO3\n - groups in the SHSPE promote Li ion diffusion, which increases Li ionic conductivity. The present findings provide design criteria for developing highly conductive self-healing SPEs.",

    "abstract": "A general algorithm is introduced to compute single‐chain partition functions in field‐theoretic simulations of polymers with nested tree‐like topologies, including self‐consistent field theory simulations that invoke the mean‐field approximation. The algorithm is an extension of a method used in a number of recent studies on the phase behavior of bottlebrush block copolymers. In those studies, the computational cost of computing single‐chain partition functions is reduced by aggregating the statistical weight of degenerate side arms. By extending this method to chains with arbitrary degrees of branching, the computational cost is reduced to scale with the total length of unique segments in the chain instead of the total length/mass of the entire chain. The method is first validated on a model dendrimer system by comparing results to coarse‐grained molecular dynamics simulations and also demonstrate its advantage over more conventional approaches to compute single‐chain partition functions. The algorithm is subsequently used to analyze the phase behavior of a molecularly informed field‐theoretic model of poly(butyl acrylate)‐graft‐poly(dodecyl acrylate) (pBA‐graft‐pDDA) copolymers in a dodecane solvent. The methodology can help advance field‐theoretic investigations of branched polymers by leveraging degeneracy in the chain to reduce computational cost and avoid the need to develop architecture‐specific algorithms.",

For preparing the spinning sheath solution, poly‐(N‐isopropylacrylamide‐co‐N‐methylolacrylamide) (PNN) copolymer having thermoresponsive and cross‐linkable properties was synthesized by free‐radical polymerization using redox initiators; it was then mixed with the conductive poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) at different weight ratios in water. On the other hand, poly(butyl acrylate‐co‐styrene) (PBS) copolymer synthesized by emulsion polymerization was dissolved in chloroform and used as the spinning core solution. After electrospinning, the fibers were treated at 110 °C for 1 h to cross‐link the PNN portion in the sheath for strengthening the fibers. Well‐defined core‐sheath fibers were observed from SEM pictures; the outside and inside (core) diameters were 568 ± 24 and 290 ± 40 nm, respectively, as determined from TEM pictures. The fiber mats were further doped by DMSO to enhance their conductivity. For the fiber mat with the weight ratio of PEDOT:PSS/PNN at 0.20 in the sheath, its surface conductivity could reach 29.4 S/cm. In addition, the fiber mats exhibited thermoresponsive properties that both swelling ratio and electric resistance decreased with temperature. Furthermore, the fiber mats exhibited improved flexibility as evaluated via bending test. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem. 2016, 54, 1299–1307",

The P(AN‐co‐BA) elastomer was randomly copolymerized by acrylonitrile (AN) and butyl acrylate (BA). The second network was formed by the crystal crosslinking of the P(AN‐co‐BA) elastomer. The tensile strength and toughness of the composites were 460% and 305% of NBR, respectively. The curves of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) exhibited peaks representing melting in the heating curves of both P(AN‐co‐BA) and P(AN‐co‐BA)/NBR composite, demonstrating crystallization in both elastomers and composites. The results of low‐field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF‐NMR) showed that the crosslink density of the composite is greater than the linear sum of the crosslink density of the NBR and the crosslink density of the elastomer, informing that the physical cross‐linked networks remain in the composite after sulfurization and new physical crosslinking appears between the NBR molecular chain and the P(AN‐co‐BA) molecular chain.

However, their use in epoxy formulations for filament winding, requiring low viscosities during the fiber‐impregnation step associated with an adequate glass transition temperature of the cured product is not trivial. In this study, we show that a blend of diglycidylether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), 4,4′‐diamino‐3,3′‐dimethyldicyclohexylmethane (3DCM) and benzylamine (BA), with 20% of amine hydrogens provided by BA, and containing 5 wt% MAM, can be used for these purposes. The addition of MAM increased the critical stress intensity factor from 0.63 MPa.m1/2 to 1.0 MPa.m1/2, the glass transition temperature from 138°C to 145°C, and the glassy modulus at 25°C from 2.95 GPa to 3.15 GPa. MAM was a better choice for the envisaged applications than MAM‐N because it led to solutions of lower viscosity. The higher viscosity produced by MAM‐N was explained by specific interactions between the epoxy‐amine solvent and DMA units present in its terminal blocks. POLYM. ENG.

To avoid the usage of isocyanates, different chemistry for the synthesis of polyurethanes is used i.e. cyclic carbonate and amine chemistry. For using this chemistry, the three acrylic monomers, Glycidyl Methacrylate (GMA), Methyl Methacrylate (MMA), and Butyl Acrylate (BA) were copolymerized via solution polymerization technique, in N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) as the reaction medium, and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator. The reaction was accompanied by the conversion of epoxy groups to cyclic carbonate groups, by the reaction of the epoxy group of GMA with carbon dioxide in presence of LiBr as a catalyst. The copolymer formed with epoxy and cyclic carbonate groups was cured with monomeric and polymeric diamines. Thin films of 50 µm were applied on steel panels and baked at 130 °C for 40 min. The mechanical optical and chemical resistance properties of the film were studied. The FTIR reports confirmed the polymerization, carbonation, and urethane linkage formation. The cyclic carbonate peak at 1800 cm−1 and urethane linkage at 3380 cm−1 and 1720 cm−1 appeared after carbonation and curing with diamine respectively.

However, to increase the efficacy of peptide-based vaccines, the application of potent adjuvant and a suitable delivery system is essential. In this study, we developed a self-adjuvanting delivery system based on a combination of polymer and liposomes, for a therapeutic vaccine against cervical cancer. Peptide epitope (8Qm) derived from HPV-16 E7 protein was conjugated to dendritic poly(tert-butyl acrylate) as a primary delivery system and incorporated into cationic liposomes, which served as a secondary delivery system. Our vaccine candidate was able to kill established HPV-16 E7-positive tumor (TC-1) cells in mice following a single immunization. The immunized mice had 80% survival rate after two months.

The hydrophilic Mc polymer membrane was successfully modified with a more hydrophobic acrylic polymer. This was to produce an insoluble membrane at room temperature where MB reagent could be immobilized to build an optical sensor for carrageenan analysis. The fluorescence intensity of MB in the composite membrane was found to be proportional to the carrageenan concentrations in a linear manner (1.0–20.0 mg L−1, R2 = 0.992) and with a detection limit at 0.4 mg L−1.

The dependency of oil-sorption capacity on parameters such as sorption time, crude oil concentration, sorbent dosage, agitation rate, and sorption temperature was considered. The empirical equilibrium data were verified using different isotherm models. The results clarified that both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm had an exceptional agreement with the laboratory data. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was 27.7 g/g for native CS, while it reached a maximum value 83.3 g/g for the grafted copolymer. The kinetic characteristics of the adsorptive performance were undertaken by practising several models. The results validated that the sorption regarded the pseudo-second-order model and film-diffusion-controlled mechanism. Besides, the thermodynamic parameters endorsed the process to be endothermic, favorable and spontaneous.

The results show that the peel strength of hot melt pressure sensitive adhesives is 1.495 kg/cm, the shear strength of hot melt pressure sensitive adhesives is 14.326 kg/cm2, adhesive warpage is 0.93 mm, adhesive color difference is 1.66, and adhesive overflow is 0.97 mm.

The Belousov–Zhabotinsky (B‐Z) reaction is coupled with the polymerization of an amphiphilic block copolymer. Radicals generated in the B‐Z reaction initiate the polymerization between a polyethylene glycol (PEG) macroreversible addition‐fragmentation chain‐transfer agent and butyl acrylate monomers. The attachment of a hydrophobic block on PEG leads to self‐assembly and formation of spherical micelles. The nanoscale micelles transform into submicrometer vesicles and grow to giant vesicles as a consequence of the oscillatory behavior of the B‐Z reaction. The one‐pot synthesis of an amphiphilic di‐block copolymer and retention of oscillatory behavior for the B‐Z reaction with the formation of giant vesicles bring a new insight into possible pathways for the synthesis of active functional microreactors in the range from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers.",

However, the selection of building blocks used in the assembly of metal–phenolic networks (MPNs), an emerging supramolecular assembly platform for particle engineering, has been essentially limited to hydrophilic molecules. Herein, we synthesized and applied biscatechol‐functionalized hydrophobic polymers (poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA)) as building blocks to engineer MPN particle systems (particles and capsules). Our method allowed control over the shell thickness (e.g., between 10 and 21 nm), stiffness (e.g., from 10 to 126 mN m−1), and permeability (e.g., 28–72 % capsules were permeable to 500 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate‐dextran) of the MPN capsules by selection of the hydrophobic polymer building blocks (PMA or PBA) and by controlling the polymer concentration in the MPN assembly solution (0.25–2.0 mM) without additional/engineered assembly processes. Molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the structural states of the hydrophobic building blocks during assembly and mechanism of film formation. Furthermore, the hydrophobic MPNs facilitated the preparation of fluorescent‐labeled and bioactive capsules through postfunctionalization and also particle–cell association engineering by controlling the hydrophobicity of the building blocks. Engineering MPN particle systems via building block hydrophobicity is expected to expand their use.",

The PBA ionomers were found to exhibit dual glass transition temperatures (Tgs) and ionic plateaus, characteristics typically observed in other amorphous ionomers. Significantly, in PBA ionomers, ionic aggregates (i.e., multiplets) functioned like chemical cross‐linking points in addition to their conventional role as physical cross‐links. This dual functionality resulted in an upward shift of the rubbery plateau and a consequent enhancement of storage moduli. In a comparative analysis of the mechanical properties of PBA, poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA), and poly(styrene‐methacrylate) (PSMA) ionomers, it was determined that the extent of ionomer clustering increased progressively from PBA ionomer to PEA ionomer to PSMA ionomer. The mechanical properties of these three ionomer systems were interpreted through the lens of multiplet formation mechanisms, with a particular focus on the quantity of multiplets and the number of ion pairs per multiplet, both of which were modulated by the matrix Tgs of each ionomer.",

The TAPA was structurally characterized, and the properties were studied. The results showed that the TAPA had a good spherical structure with a median particle size (D50) of 16.03 μm. The initial expansion temperature Tstart of the TAPA was 134.75 °C, and its maximum expansion temperature Tmax was 197.77 °C. The surface was hydrophilic and negatively charged, with excellent shear strength and sealing. The TAPA was suitable for temporary plugging and self-removal of the plugging of the reservoir formation with a temperature of 160 °C. The release of core materials and the effect on self-removal of plugging were not significantly affected with different salinities, weak acid or weak alkali environments, or a small quantity of hydrocarbons. With addition of 1–3 wt % TAPA, the rheological property of water-based drilling fluid changed slightly, but the filtration loss reduced, suggesting a good compatibility of the TAPA with the drilling fluid. Results of plugging and plugging removal experiments in fractured reservoir formations and permeable reservoir formations showed that the TAPA improved the strength of the temporary plugging layer with the elastic deformation due to thermal expansion and realized self-removal of the plugging by corroding the temporary plugging layer with carboxylic acid hydrolyzed from the carboxylic ester released, thereby decreasing the backflow pressure of oil and gas wells in the production stage.

Interestingly, AA and VI not only form hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds simultaneously but also segregate into aggregates of different sizes, thereby successfully mimicking the hierarchical structure of mussel byssal threads. When applying external forces, the weak hydrogen bonds are broken at first and then the ionic bonds and aggregates are disrupted progressively from small to large deformations. Such multiple energy-dissipation mechanisms lead to the outstanding damping property of the HDEs. Therefore, the HDEs outperform commercially available rubbers in terms of sound absorption and vibration damping. Furthermore, the multiple energy-dissipation mechanisms impart the HDEs with high toughness (41.1 MJ/m3), tensile strength (21.3 MPa), and self-healing ability.",

Brid. protoplasts, and to evaluate the level of their phytotoxicity. Methods. Organic synthesis; DNA gel retardation assay; adapted PEG-mediated transformation protocol; PCR; light microscopy. Results. The formation of pDNA complex with DMAEMA-based carriers took place at 0.01-0.1 % concentrations of the polymer. The poly-DMAEMA carriers F8-DM1, F8-DM2 (fluorine-containing), LAcr-DM1, LAcr-DM2 (lauryl acrylate-containing), BAcr-DM1, and BAcr-DM2 (butyl acrylate-containing) were effective as carriers of plasmid DNA pSF3 at C. purpureus transformation . PCR analysis confirmed that the transformants of C. purpureus moss contain GFP as a gene of interest after the protoplast transformation by polymers LAcr-DM2, LAcr-DM1, BAcr-DM2, BAcr-DM1 and F8-DM2. The poly-DMAEMA carriers at working concentration (0.0025 %) were relatively non-toxic for protoplasts of C. purpureus moss. 83.1-93.9 % of viable protoplasts of C. purpureus moss were found after the treatment with studied carriers at that dose. However, at 0.25 % i.e. 100 times higher concentration than that used for moss transformation, the poly-DMAEMA carriers reached their IC 50 level. Conclusion. The novel block-like poly-DMAEMA carriers were effective in transformation of C. purpureus moss protoplasts and demonstrated low toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Sulfide‐based all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) have been featured as promising alternatives to the current lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) mainly owing to their superior safety. Nevertheless, a solution‐based scalable manufacturing scheme has not yet been established because of the incompatible polarity of the binder, solvent, and sulfide electrolyte during slurry preparation. This dilemma is overcome by subjecting the acrylate (co)polymeric binders to protection−deprotection chemistry. Protection by the tert‐butyl group allows for homogeneous dispersion of the binder in the slurry based on a relatively less polar solvent, with subsequent heat‐treatment during the drying process to cleave the tert‐butyl group. This exposes the polar carboxylic acid groups, which are then able to engage in hydrogen bonding with the active cathode material, high‐nickel layered oxide. Deprotection strengthens the electrode adhesion such that the strength equals that of commercial LIB electrodes, and the key electrochemical performance parameters are improved markedly in both half‐cell and full‐cell settings. The present study highlights the potential of sulfide‐based ASSBs for scalable manufacturing and also provides insights that protection−deprotection chemistry can generally be used for various battery cells that suffer from polarity incompatibility among multiple electrode components.",

    "abstract": "The search for Li-ion batteries offering increased energy, power, and safety has led researchers to develop solid-state Li batteries (ASSB) and more recently, quasi-solid electrolytes (QSEs) prepared by in situ polymerization to accelerate their practical implementation. A complex challenge with QSEs arises in designing polymer matrices having high ionic conductivity that are stable against oxidation, safe and scalable. Herein, we developed a novel QSE through in situ polymerization of butyl acrylate monomer in adiponitrile (ADN)-based electrolyte. Benefiting from a solvation-competing mechanism, polybutyl acrylate (PBA) expels the nitrile solvent from the Li+ solvation shell, which significantly inhibits side reactions between ADN and Li metal, thereby forming a robust solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The PBA in the QSE also contributes to an enhanced lithium-ion transference number (tLi+ = 0.87) and minimized concentration polarization. As a result, the QSE-based LCO||Li cell retains 78% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at 4.45 V, along with outstanding rate performance. The excellent performance and safety are also validated in a 250 Wh kg-1 pouch cell.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The high brittleness of epoxy resins (ERs) restricts their high‐performance applications, while traditional toughening methods typically face a conflict between toughness and strength. To address this issue, existing studies have alleviated the conflict between toughness and strength by introducing rigid‐flexible structures or non‐covalent sacrificial bonds into the cross‐linked polymer networks. However, these methods often involve complex synthesis processes, and the atom utilization efficiency remains to be improved. Therefore, this study proposes a simple and cost‐effective strategy by synthesizing a novel modified curing agent (BA‐ZT) through the Aza‐Michael addition reaction between trimethylolpropane tri‐polypropylene glycol ether (amine‐terminated, ZT‐143) and n‐butyl acrylate (BA). Benefiting from the three‐terminal amino structure of ZT‐143, this curing agent induces the formation of dense plastic zones in the cross‐linked polymer networks while preserving a good cross‐linking density. Experimental results demonstrate that the modified curing agent increases the elongation at break of the ER to 77.0%, nearly 490.09% higher than that of the unmodified ER, while retaining good tensile strength (27.97 MPa). However, the thermal decomposition temperature and glass transition temperature (Tg) are reduced.

Herein, photoswitchable poly(methyl methacrylate-co-vinylimidazole-co-spiropyran ethyl acrylate) (MVSP) and its copolymer with butyl acrylate (MBVSP) were prepared via emulsion polymerization, and the corresponding nanofibers (MVSP@NF and MBVSP@NF) and nanocomposite fibers (MVSP/Au@NF and MBVSP/Au@NF) containing AuNRs were fabricated through electrospinning. FTIR and 1H NMR analyses confirmed the progress of the copolymerization reaction. The morphology of the prepared nanofibers containing AuNRs with an aspect ratio of 2.5 was identified by SEM and TEM techniques. The inclusion of vinylimidazole into the copolymer chains resulted in well-dispersed AuNRs. Photoisomerization studies revealed a higher photochromic efficiency for MBVSP@F (reflective intensity of 37.4%) with respect to MVSP@NF (reflective intensity of 62.5%) because of the greater flexibility of the chains. In addition, the presence of AuNRs in the nanocomposite fibers with high absorptivity intensified the photochromic properties for both samples. The polarization-dependent plasmonic band of AuNRs was switched between 650 and 634 nm through the photoisomerization of nonpolar SP to polar MC reversibly for MVSP/Au@NF. This displacement was just 4 nm for MBVSP/Au@NF, owing to the limited coupling between AuNRs and MC isomers. Besides, the capability of both nanocomposite fibers for reversible optical patterning was investigated by fast write-erase cycles. Enhanced photofatigue resistance in those fibers and the photomodulation of the plasmonic band of AuNRs using SP to MC isomerization revealed their promising potential for optical patterning and on-demand real-time plasmonic devices.",

Polymer-based delivery systems are particularly promising due to their versatile chemical structure and convenient adaptability, but struggle with the toxicity-efficiency dilemma. Introducing anionic, hydrophilic, or \"stealth\" functionalities represents a promising approach to overcome this dilemma in gene delivery. Here, two sets of diblock terpolymers are created comprising hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA), a copolymer segment made of hydrophilic 4-acryloylmorpholine (NAM), and either the cationic 3-guanidinopropyl acrylamide (GPAm) or the 2-carboxyethyl acrylamide (CEAm), which is negatively charged at neutral conditions. These oppositely charged sets of diblocks are co-assembled in different ratios to form mixed micelles. Since this experimental design enables countless mixing possibilities, a machine learning approach is applied to identify an optimal GPAm/CEAm ratio for achieving high transfection efficiency and cell viability with little resource expenses. After two runs, an optimal ratio to overcome the toxicity-efficiency dilemma is identified.

Here, a novel three-armed polymer based on benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) is developed and the polymer could be further complexed by metal ions to form dynamic zinc-imidazole interactions. In this system, BTA is located in the center, and the ligand-functionalized monomer is copolymerized with n-butyl acrylate to form three chains. This is the first time BTA is introduced to a self-healing system to endow the polymer with assembly and self-healing properties. The composition, chemical structure, assembly behavior, mechanical properties, and self-healing properties of the polymer are investigated. It is revealed that the assembly behavior of the polymer depends on the BTA contents and time. The mechanical property can be easily tuned by ligand/metal ratio and is significantly adjusted by the polymer chain length and environment humidity. Long polymer chains not only contribute to good mechanical property but also promote the self-healing process due to the effective physical entanglement.",

A series of poly(methyl methacrylate)‐b‐poly(n‐butyl acrylate) (PMMA‐b‐PnBA) diblock copolymers with various compositions was synthesized via reversible addition–fragmentation chain‐transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization with the amphiphilic oligo(methacrylic acid41‐b‐methyl methacrylate8) RAFT agent as both the polymerization mediator and surfactant. The molecular weights of the block copolymers agreed well with the theoretical prediction, although the polydispersity indices were relatively broad. The resulting core [poly(n‐butyl acrylate)]–shell (PMMA) particles of PMMA‐b‐PnBA were found to be very effective impact modifiers for polycarbonate (PC). The diblock copolymer was well dispersed in 100–300‐nm particles in the PC matrix, and the dispersed particle size was highly dependent on the block copolymer compositions. PMMA250‐b‐PnBA550 (the subscripted number signifies the designed degree of polymerization), which was dispersed into 100‐nm particles, presented the best capability for improving the impacting properties.

    "abstract": "Present industrial development has a great demand for butyl acrylate, an important basic chemical. Efficient synthesis and separation processes are very important for the clean manufacturing of butyl acrylate. In this work, two processes for the preparation of butyl acrylate by reactive distillation coupled with azeotropic distillation (RD-AD) or pervaporation (RD-PV) were proposed. By changing the ratio of reactants, the economic performance of the two processes under different specifications of butyl acrylate was analyzed, and the environmental impact of the two processes in the production process were analyzed. First, the process design using different purity specifications was completed focusing on the reaction kinetics. Then, based on the sequential iterative algorithm, process optimization was carried out with the minimum total annual cost (TAC) as the objective function, and the process with optimal operating conditions was obtained. Finally, TAC and the global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), abiotic depletion potential (ADP) and human toxic potential (HTP) were used to assess the economic and environmental performance of the proposed processes. The results showed that the RD-AD process had better economic performance, whereas the RD-PV process had better environmental performance. According to the results, the parameters that influenced the TAC for products with different purities were obtained. The TAC of the RD-AD process was 41.39% lower than that of the RD-PV process, and GWP, AP, and ADP of the RD-PV process were respectively 12.67%, 13.68%, and 13.07% lower than those of the RD-AD process.",

    "abstract": "Poly(vinyl imidazole)s, which contain heterocyclic aromatic rings on the polymer side chains, are of increasing interest for a wide variety of applications ranging from catalysis, polymeric ionic liquids to membrane material. However, the controlled radical polymerization of vinyl imidazoles, including 1-vinyl imidazole (1VIM), 2-vinyl imidazole (2VIM) and 4-vinyl imidazole (4VIM), proved to be extremely challenging in the past decades. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that well-controlled and low dispersity (Đ as low as 1.05) poly(1VIM) could be synthesized via RAFT polymerization by using acetic acid as a special solvent. Acetic acid not only works as a solvent that allows homogeneous polymerization, it also protonates 1VIM, thereby, allowing the stabilization of propagating radicals during polymerization. To verify the efficacy of the RAFT polymerization of 1VIM in acetic acid, various polymerization parameters including different RAFT agents, initiator and monomer concentrations, temperatures, etc. had been examined. Moreover, detailed kinetic studies revealed a linear, pseudo-first-order polymerization behavior of 1VIM in acetic acid, and the apparent rate constants were calculated. Furthermore, the living characteristic of this RAFT process was demonstrated by chain extension with n-butyl acrylate (nBA) and N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMA) to form respective block copolymers with low dispersities. Overall, the synthesis of well-controlled poly(1VIM) is expected to greatly expand the design and utility of vinyl imidazole-based materials and their applications in catalysis, membrane material, heavy metal removal, fuel cells and many other fields.",

Methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate were copolymerized with various amounts of bio-based derivatives (5 – 30 wt% in monomer mixture) to obtain polymeric latexes for coating applications. Successful emulsion polymerizations with up to 25 wt% of the bio-based derivatives were performed with low coagulum (below 2%) and high monomer conversion (around 95%). The incorporation of bio-based derivatives into polymeric latexes was confirmed with infrared spectroscopy. Asymmetric flow field flow fractionation coupled with a multi-angle light scattering was used to analyze the synthesized copolymers in terms of their molar mass distribution. The results revealed that copolymerizing the bio-based derivatives resulted in ultra-high molar mass nanogel fractions formed because of multi-acrylated ingredients derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. The phenomenon of nanogel formation became more pronounced for the linseed oil-based derivative. Evaluated coating properties showed that latexes comprising the bio-based derivatives provided increased water repellence (about 10° higher water contact angles were achieved for all bio-based coating compositions in contrast to a reference latex). Moreover, latexes comprising chemically modified oils in the content of 25 and 30 wt% provided water whitening-resistant coatings, making the bio-based derivatives promising candidates for replacing petroleum-based monomers in the production of sustainable latex coatings.

Regarding heat resistance and stiffness, crystallinity appears to be the key parameter: above a critical value of 10 % crystallinity a sharp improvement of the properties can be noticed.

Although stress relaxation behavior of polymer films has been studied for several decades, little work has addressed random copolymers. We probed the residual stress relaxation in non-equilibrated random copolymer films of styrene (S) and n-butyl acrylate (nBA) using two optical techniques, ellipsometry and fluorescence. Both techniques show that incorporation of very low levels of nBA (2 mol% to 5 mol%) in S/nBA random copolymers can lead to dramatic increases in stress relaxation time of copolymer films relative to neat polystyrene films. For example, relative to polystyrene, the bulk-film stress relaxation time at 130 °C of 95/5 mol% S/nBA copolymer increases by factors of at least six as determined by ellipsometry and three as determined by fluorescence. Nanoconfined, 25-nm-thick films exhibit similar differences.

An AlphaScreen assay along with the cell-free expression technique were employed to evaluate the affinity of this polymer toward toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) for stimulation of innate immunity.

The AlphaScreen assay showed the inability of polymer to bind to TLR2, while the Pam2Cys displayed very strong binding to TLR2 as expected.

During the Pb-ISE sensor fabrication process, the membrane composition optimization process has been carried out. The best sensor composition contained 1 mg potassium tetrakis (4-chlorophenyl) borate (KTpClPB) and 4.3 mg Pb ionophore IV. The fabricated Pb-ISE had a Nernstian number of 28.2 ± 0.5 mV/dec, a broad linear range from 10 -3 to 10 -10 M and a limit of detection (LOD) of (6.6 ± 1.6) x 10 -11 M, providing an excellent performance. In addition, the sensor showed a fairly good coefficient of effectiveness (CE) (Log K pota,b ) against K + (potassium), Na + (sodium), NH 4+ (ammonium), Mg 2+ (magnesium), Cu 2+ (copper) and Cd 2+ (cadmium) cations, which were -6.6 ± 0.2, -6.1 ± 0.2, -6.7 ± 0.2, -12.4 ± 0.3, -4.4 ± 0.2 and -6.1 ± 0.1, respectively. The Pb-ISE sensor worked best in the pH range from 3 to 8. The validation process has been carried out by comparing the measurements results of the artificial samples, at the concentrations from 25 to 100 ppm, with those of the real sample from Angke river water. The outcome was outstanding and comparable to that of the standard UV-Vis spectrophotometry measurement methods.",

In this work, the dielectric permittivity of reduced graphene oxide-incorporated styrene-butyl acrylate (rGO@SBA) composite microspheres synthesized by mini-emulsion polymerization was significantly improved. rGO with 2 wt% content gave a dielectric permittivity of 11 356 (at 1 KHz), which was 1925 times higher than that of pure SBA (5.9). SEM and TEM were conducted to observe the morphology and structure of the composite microspheres. After filling into polystyrene (PS), a segregated structure of (rGO@SBA) that enables a concentrated aggregation of rGO in SBA was fabricated. The dielectric permittivity of PS could reach 10.91 (at 1 KHz) by incorporating only 0.39 wt% rGO by using this segregated structure of (rGO@SBA). PS simply mixed with SBA microspheres and graphite (PS/rGO-SBA) was also fabricated as a comparison group to verify the effect of this segregated structure on the dielectric properties of the composites. After comparing the dielectric properties of PS composites with different structures, the enhancement in dielectric permittivity of the composites can be demonstrated.",

In addition, the amount of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in each modified PF was decreased, which obviously increase the thermal stabilities of the modified PFs. The study found that the P(BA-co-MA) was micro spherically distributed in the PF matrix, and P(BA-co-MA) microspheres were tightly bound to the matrix due to the esterification reaction.

A particularly unique and translatable aspect of this work was the use of a monomer obtained from real biomass, as opposed to a model compound or lignin-mimic, to generate well-defined and nanostructure-forming polymers. Herein, poplar wood depolymerization followed by minimal purification steps (filtration and extraction) produced two aromatic compounds, 4-propylsyringol and 4-propylguaiacol, with high purity and yield. Efficient functionalization of those aromatic compounds with either acrylate or methacrylate groups generated monomers that could be easily polymerized by a scalable reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) process to yield polymeric materials with high glass transition temperatures and robust thermal stabilities, especially relative to other potentially biobased alternatives. These lignin-derived compounds were used as a major component in low-dispersity triblock polymers composed of 4-propylsyringyl acrylate and n-butyl acrylate (also can be biobased). The resulting PSAs exhibited excellent adhesion to stainless steel without the addition of any tackifier or plasticizer. The 180° peel forces were up to 4 N cm–1, and tack forces were up to 2.5 N cm–1, competitive with commercial Fisherbrand labeling tape and Scotch Magic tape, demonstrating the practical significance of our biomass-derived materials.",

The copolymer synthesis was controlled by the concentration of monomer BA and AIBN, reaction time, and temperature. It was found that the optimal conditions for the highest graft yield of 41.50% were as follows: [AIBN] = 0.04 mol/L, [BA] = 1.50 mol/L, 180 min at 75 °C. The graft copolymer RS-g-BA was structurally analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In the presence of DVB (1.5%), the maximal adsorption capacity of the copolymer was 20.56 g/g. The reusability of the RS-g-BA copolymer was assessed during seven sorption/desorption cycles with 70% recovery. The experimental data were clearly more suitably fitted by the Langmuir monolayer adsorption model rather than by the Freundlich isotherm model.

Polymer resin containing carbonate group has many desirable properties, such as high transmittance, acid sensitivity and chemical formulation, thus serving as potential photoresist material. In this work, a series of aqueous developable CO2-sourced polycarbonate (CO2-PC) were produced via alternating copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides bearing acid-cleavable cyclic acetal groups in the presence of tetranuclear organoborane catalyst. The produced CO2-PCs were investigated as chemical amplification resists in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Under the catalysis of photoacid, the acetal (ketal) groups in CO2-PC were hydrolysed into two equivalents of hydroxyl groups, which changes the exposed areas from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity, thus enabling the exposed regions to be developed in water. Through normalized remaining thickness analysis, the optimal CO2-derived resist achieved a remarkable sensitivity of 1.9 mJ/cm2, a contrast of 7.9, a favorable resolution (750 nm, half pitch), and etching resistance (38% higher than poly(tert-butyl acrylate)). Such performances outperforming commercial KrF and ArF chemical amplification resists (i.e., polyhydroxystyrene-derived and polymethacrylate-based resists), which endows broad application prospects in the field of DUV (248 nm and 193 nm) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and nanomanufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen bonding is the most common noncovalent reversible interaction leading to supramolecular polymeric assemblies. Shabbir et al. (Macromolecules 48:5988–5996, 2015) reported both linear and nonlinear rheological data for a model system consisting of pure poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) homopolymer and three PnBA-poly(acrylic acid) (PnBA-PAA) copolymers with different numbers of acrylic acid (AA) side groups. Hydrogen bonds between the AA groups not only cause the storage and loss modulus to shift in the direction of a power law scaling of 0.5 in the terminal relaxation regime, but also the elongational viscosity shows increasing strain hardening with a strongly nonlinear dependence on the number of hydrogen bonding groups. Based on the “Sticky Rouse” model and a constitutive equation of the Doi-Edwards type with consideration of chain stretch, we model the effect of hydrogen bonding on the elongational viscosity of the PnBA-AA copolymers. We show that the elongational viscosity data are consistent with a Sticky Rouse relaxation modulus of the AA associations characterized by a constant modulus GA\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$G_{A}$$\\end{document} and a constant sticker life time τA\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\tau_{A}$$\\end{document}, while the complexity of the hydrogen assemblies as quantified by the Sticky Rouse time increases with the concentration of AA groups from the order of seconds (3% AA) to hours (6%AA) and to 1 day (13%AA), and leads to extreme strain hardening. The elongational stress shows a steady state at large strains and the stretch reaches a limiting value independent of strain rate. At the highest concentration of AA groups investigated (38%AA), the PnBA-AA copolymer is a weak gel fracturing at a critical strain, and the sticker life time loses its significance. The effect of the Sticky Rouse time on self-healing is discussed.",

    "reasoning": "The abstract discusses the rheological properties of poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) and its copolymers with poly(acrylic acid) (PnBA-PAA) containing hydrogen bonding groups. However, it does not explicitly state that these copolymers are safer alternatives to butyl acrylate, nor does it mention any safety advantages or comparisons related to toxicity or environmental impact. The focus is on mechanical and rheological behavior, not safety.",
