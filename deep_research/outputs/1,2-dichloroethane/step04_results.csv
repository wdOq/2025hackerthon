Exploring Solvent Effects in the Radiosynthesis of 18F-Labeled Thymidine Analogues toward Clinical Translation for Positron Emission Tomography Imaging.,10.1021/acsptsci.0c00184,2020,"1,2-dichloroethane","The abstract explicitly states that 1,4-dioxane is used to replace 1,2-dichloroethane and is analyzed as a better solvent in terms of toxicity concern, indicating a safety advantage. It also mentions that the less toxic solvent allows translation to clinical production, supporting that 1,4-dioxane is a safer alternative to 1,2-dichloroethane.","1,4-dioxane",
Green Catalytic Synthesis of Ethylenediamine from Ethylene Glycol and Monoethanolamine: A Review,10.1021/acsomega.4c00709,2024,"1,2-dichloroethane","The abstract explicitly compares the catalytic amination of ethylene glycol (EG) to the industrial ammonolysis of 1,2-dichloroethane, describing the EG route as 'economical and environmentally benign,' which indicates a safety advantage. This suggests that the catalytic amination of EG is a safer alternative to 1,2-dichloroethane for ethylenediamine synthesis.",ethylene glycol,
Rapid removal of detergent in glycolipids using ionic liquids,10.1007/s44211-022-00139-x,2022,"1,2-dichloroethane","The abstract explicitly states that 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) has drawbacks including environmental risks, harmful effects (potentially carcinogenic), and high vaporability and flammability. It then presents 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, an ionic liquid, as a suitable alternative for DCE in detergent removal from glycolipid samples, implying a safer option.",1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide,"environmental risks, potentially carcinogenic, high vaporability, flammability"
Study on Sustainable Recovery and Extraction of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) Produced by Cupriavidus necator Using Waste Glycerol for Medical Applications,10.15255/CABEQ.2018.1471,2019,"1,2-dichloroethane","The abstract explicitly states that the extraction of the copolymer using solvents such as propylene carbonate, butyl acetate, isoamyl alcohol, and ethyl acetate could help in replacing generally used chlorinated toxic solvents, such as 1,2-dichloroethane. This indicates these solvents are presented as safer alternatives to 1,2-dichloroethane due to the mention of chlorinated solvents being toxic and the use of recyclable solvents instead.",propylene carbonate; butyl acetate; isoamyl alcohol; ethyl acetate,
