Two pretreatment methods for solid samples, QuEChERS (quick easy cheap efficient rugged and safe) and a standard method, were used to isolate four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the sample matrix. However, since these methods result in analyte dilution, DLLME was used to augment them by concentrating the analytes from 8.0 mL of sample into 150 µL of 1,2-dichloroethane. Under the optimum conditions, the instrumental detection limit was enhanced by approximately 100-fold for chrysene, benzo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[k]fluoranthene with corresponding detection limits of 29, 29, 30, and 28 ng/L, respectively. The precision of the method based on inter-analyst and inter-day analysis yielded relative standard deviations less than 9.0 and 4.0%, respectively. The optimized method was applied to snail samples spiked at 5.0, 10, 20, and 50 ng/g and the recoveries were nearly 100%.

    "abstract": "The production of vinyl chloride (VCM) by pyrolysis of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) is an important process in the ethylene-based poly(vinyl chloride) industry. The pyrolysis is performed at temperatures above 500 °C, gives low conversions, and has high energy consumption. We have shown that N-doped carbon catalysts give excellent performances in DCE dehydrochlorination at 280 °C. The current understanding of the active sites, mechanism, and kinetics of DCE dehydrochlorination over N-doped carbon catalysts is limited. Here, we showed that pyridinic-N on a N-doped carbon catalyst is the active site for catalytic production of vinyl chloride monomer from DCE. The results of CO2 and DCE temperature-programmed desorption experiments showed that the pyridinic-N catalytic sites are basic, and the mechanism of dehydrochlorination on a N-doped carbon catalyst involves a carbanion. A kinetic study of dehydrochlorination showed that the surface reaction rate on the N-doped carbon catalyst was the limiting step in the catalytic dehydrochlorination of DCE. This result enabled clarification of the dehydrochlorination mechanism and optimization of the reaction process. These findings will stimulate further studies to increase our understanding of the relationship between the base strength and catalytic performance. The results of this study provide a method for catalyst optimization, namely modification of the amount of pyridinic-N and the base strength of the catalyst, to increase the surface reaction rate of DCE dehydrochlorination on N-doped carbon catalysts.",

The outcomes demonstrated that the Cr2O3 is the perfect targeted base catalyst adding to the facts that the hydrothermal approach is an appropriate way to create catalysts with superior properties.

Electrochemistry has recently emerged as a method to robustly probe volumes even down to the attoliter (10-18 L) level. We present a concentration enrichment strategy based on the dissolution of a microdroplet placed on the surface of a Au ultramicroelectrode (radius ∼ 6.25 μm). By precisely positioning a 1,2-dichloroethane microdroplet onto the ultramicroelectrode with a microinjector, we are able to track the droplet's behavior optically and electrochemically. Because the droplet spontaneously dissolves over time, given the relative solubility of 1,2-dichloroethane in the water continuous phase, the change in volume with time enriches the concentration of the redox probe (Cp2*(Fe)II) in the droplet. We demonstrate robust electrochemical detection down to sub-nM (800 pM) concentrations of Cp2*(Fe)II. For this droplet, 800 pM constitutes only about 106 molecules. We extend the strategy in a single-blind study to determine unknown concentrations, emphasizing the promise of the new methodology.

    "doi": "10.3897/aca.6.e111354",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Sulfidated nano zerovalent iron (S-nZVI) has garnered significant attention from researchers due to its potential for effective in-situ remediation applications. Compared to bare nZVI, sulfidation process enhances its reactivity towards chlorinated volatile organic compounds (cVOCs) and improves its longevity (Nunez Garcia et al. 2021). Stabilizing the particles with a polymer, like carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), can further improve the performance of S-nZVI by imparting higher stability, less toxicity towards microbial cells, and a potential biostimulatory effect, making CMC-S-nZVI a promising in-situ remediation technology (Nunez Garcia et al. 2021).\n Recently, CMC-S-nZVI has also been applied for field-scale remediation (Nunez Garcia et al. 2020;Brumovský et al. 2021). The contaminated sites usually have multiple pollutants and not all can be degraded by CMC-S-nZVI, thus, leaving some recalcitrant cVOCs untreated (Zhang et al. 2021). Biodegradation of cVOCs by dechlorinating microbial cultures may generate highly toxic intermediates like vinyl chloride (Kocur et al. 2016). However, coupling the two treatments may be able to compensate for each other’s drawbacks, resulting in higher efficiency, longer effectiveness, non-accumulation of intermediates, and degradation of a wider range of target contaminants. However, interacting effects of CMC-S-nZVI on dechlorinating microbial cultures have not been studied yet.\n This research investigates the potential of combining CMC-S-nZVI and a reductive dechlorinating microbial culture (KB-1) to degrade trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA). CMC-S-nZVI was synthesized by a two-step method: (1) CMC-nZVI was first synthesized by reducing ferrous sulfate-CMC solution with dropwise addition of sodium borohydride solution with continuous mixing and (2) then sodium dithionite solution was added as a sulfidation agent to the freshly-synthesized CMC-nZVI (Nunez Garcia et al. 2020). Effects of different sulfur-iron ratios (S/Fe), iron, and CMC concentrations on TCE degradation were studied to obtain an effective CMC-S-nZVI formulation. Results showed a successful TCE removal by the CMC-S-nZVI but 1,2-DCA was not degraded. TCE degradation by CMC-S-nZVI fitted the first-order kinetic model, with the highest degradation rate constant (0.35 h-1) achieved at S/Fe = 0.1 with iron and CMC concentrations of 1 gL-1 and 0.4 wt%, respectively. This CMC-S-nZVI formulation was further tested to examine its interaction with KB-1 in terms of cVOCs dechlorination and microbial population responses. A four-day aged CMC-S-nZVI was also tested to study the effect of aging. Degradation pathways for TCE and 1,2-DCA were proposed, based on the formation of degradation products.\n For the coupled treatment, an increase in microbial abundance was observed by quantifying DNA concentrations. This demonstrated a synergistic relationship between CMC-S-nZVI and KB-1. Unlike the CMC-S-nZVI only treatment, microcosms containing both CMC-S-nZVI and KB-1 were found to successfully degrade the 1,2-DCA. The coupled treatment degraded TCE and 1,2-DCA at faster rates and generated lesser amounts of vinyl chloride than the KB-1 only treatment, confirming the biostimulatory effect of CMC-S-nZVI. In the KB-1 only treatment with CMC as the sole carbon and energy source, TCE and 1,2-DCA were successfully dechlorinated. Transmission electron microscopy illustrated that CMC-S-nZVI particles were attached to the microbes but did not penetrate the bacterial cells. \n In summary, synergistic abiotic-biotic dechlorination of TCE and 1,2-DCA was achieved by the combined treatment of CMC-S-nZVI and KB-1, suggesting that multi-contaminant sites can benefit from this approach. Additionally, the four-day aged CMC-S-nZVI performed similar to the freshly-synthesized one, demonstrating that the field-scale remediation can have a more feasible time scale for the preparation and application of these amendments.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "The open circuit potential (OCP) measurements are used to study the single collisions of the DCE-in-water emulsion droplets containing an electrolyte (tetradodecylammonium chloride, TDDACl) with the polarizable water/1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) interface. The OCP transients exhibit a series of the potential spikes, which consist of the initial negative potential step followed by a slower relaxation of the potential to its original value. A novel mechanism of the collisions is proposed including the interpretation of the potential response shape. Low stability of the emulsion system precluded a convincing comparison of the OCP and DLS data, though in some cases the size distributions obtained by OCP and DLS measurements may coincide. A comparison of the interfacial tension or capacitance curves measured in the absence and presence of the emulsion droplets indicates that their specific adsorption at the water/DCE interface is negligible. The mean droplet diameter exhibits a monotonic increase with the increasing droplet concentration and time pointing to an increasing effect of the flocculation and coalescence. The change of the collision frequency with the emulsion droplet concentration can be rationalized by using a steady-state diffusion transport model, which predicts that the collision frequency scales down with the fourth power of the droplet diameter. The droplet size distribution is not much affected by a change in the TDDACl concentration, which leads to the proportional change of the total charge integrated from all the emulsion droplet collisions. However, the total charge itself represents only a small fraction of the charge theoretically available, which suggests that a large portion of the collisions are accompanied by the zero-net charge transfer of the neutral ion pair TDDA+Cl−, and/or a number of the droplets are lost through their accumulation on the glass walls of the experimental system. The DCE-in-water emulsion exhibits a very low stability, which is manifested primarily by a strong effect of the droplet concentration on the mean droplet diameter or by its increase with time, as well as by a difference in the droplet size distributions averaged over different time spans. Breakdown of this emulsion system seems to occur through a combination of the flocculation, coalescence and sedimentation. Nevertheless, the OCP measurements provide a valuable insight into its interfacial dynamic behavior.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Contamination of soil and groundwater by chlorinated solvents is an environmental issue of primary concern. Recently, electrically conductive iron particles have been proposed as a novel approach to accelerate anaerobic bioremediation processes. In fact, it was demonstrated that conductive particles facilitate the exchange of electrons between microorganisms via Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer (DIET) processes, thus enhancing the pollutant-degrading potential of the microbial community. However, the use of natural minerals in this context has not been reported so far. In this study, we applied, for the first time, natural magnetite and hematite to accelerate the reductive dechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane by an enrichment culture in lab-scale anaerobic microcosms. After four feeding cycles, low magnetite-amended microcosms (13 mg/L) yielded the highest rate of 1,2-DCA reductive dechlorination and reduced methanogenic activity. By contrast, hematite did not display any apparent stimulatory effect. Surprisingly, in the presence of higher amounts of iron oxides, a weaker effect was obtained, probably because iron(III) present in the minerals competed for the electrons necessary for reductive dechlorination. For all microcosms, the concentration of the toxic byproduct vinyl chloride was negligible throughout the whole study. The SEM/EDS analysis confirmed the close interaction between the conductive iron oxide particles and the dechlorinating bacteria. This work opens the possibility of using natural conductive minerals for bioremediation applications as well as shedding light on the previously unrecognized role of such minerals in contaminated ecosystems.",

Compared with other supports and conventionally impregnated methods, the Ru@ZSM-5 catalyst synthesized by the in-situ encapsulation strategy exhibited an excellent low-temperature catalytic performance (T\n                     50 = 262 °C, T\n                     90 = 327 °C), superior stability in long-term test as well as ideal target products. The acidity, specific surface area, and interaction with precious metals of the supports have significant influences on the catalytic activity, and the Ru clusters inside the pore structures are more closely bound to the framework Al species, which promotes the oxidation behavior. The encapsulation strategy also significantly improves the Ru dispersion thereby facilitates oxygen activation as well as Cl-containing volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) deep oxidation, and preserves large amounts of Brønsted acid sites to optimize the hydrolysis mechanism for purification of CVOCs. Subsequently, the synergistic effect between metal redox and acidity is greatly optimized, thus extremely promoting the catalytic efficiency of 1,2-DCE oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Air samples were collected at Mt. Fuji Research Station (FRS) for the measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the summers of 2015 and 2016. In this study, 24 compounds were analyzed, of which only 12 halocarbons were quantified in 2015. The average total concentrations of target VOCs were 2.62 ± 1.38 and 2.99 ± 0.95 ppb in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The concentrations of individual VOCs ranged from a few ppt to a few ppb, indicating a highly inhomogeneous feature at the FRS. A cluster analysis of 3-day backward trajectories was performed for the sampling time. Except for the aromatic compounds, the VOCs showed relatively low concentrations in association with air masses originating from the coastal region in the low latitudes (15°N–35°N) of East Asia in 2015. By contrast, the clusters with elevated VOC concentrations mainly came from the high latitudes (35°N–60°N) of the Asian continent in 2016. No particular diurnal pattern was found for VOCs and CO, which might have resulted from suppressed mountain-valley winds at the FRS. Halocarbons regulated by the Montreal Protocol showed low variability and were in favorable agreement with background values at the Gosan station (GSN) and those reported in the literature. Other partially halogenated compounds with higher variability, such as CH3Cl and CHCl3, showed discrepancies at the FRS and GSN. 1,2-dichloroethane (R-150), 1,1-dichloroethane (R-150a), and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) were also measured at the FRS with concentrations of 24 ± 14, 38 ± 13, and 13 ± 10 ppt, respectively, in 2015. A close relationship between n-pentane and i-pentane with R2 more than 0.85 was found in both 2015 and 2016.

The effect of different substituents in the boronic ester, the nature of the diamine linker, and the effect of the solvent was explored. Stable 2 : 1 B←N adducts with diamines such as 1,3-diaminopropane were produced in solutions of hydrogen-bonding acceptor solvents (acetonitrile and ethyl acetate), which can be isolated in the solid state as crystalline solvates, whereas the use of noncoordinating solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane afforded mainly 1 : 1 B←N adducts. In suitable combinations, aromatic bis-pyridyl diamines produced stable 2 : 1 B←N adducts that were isolated either as solvent-free solids, solvates, or cocrystals. In these crystalline forms, double-tweezer hosts were observed with an exceptional syn/anti conformational guest-adaptability driven by simultaneous donor-acceptor and C-H⋅⋅⋅π interactions in the tweezer cavities, resembling preorganized covalent tweezer hosts.

    "abstract": "The ability of analytical strategies to detect and positively identify molecules under extremely dilute conditions is important for the growth and expansion of analytical techniques and instrumentation. At present, few measurement science techniques can robustly approach the measurement of just a few thousand molecules. Here, we present an electrochemical platform for the detection and positive identification of fewer than 1000 molecules of decamethylferrocene ((Cp*)2FeII). We achieve this remarkable detection threshold by trapping (Cp*)2FeII in a 1,2-dichloroethane microdroplet, which is allowed to dissolve into an aqueous continuous phase while on a gold microelectrode (radius ∼6.25 μm). Because electrochemistry is not sensitive enough to observe the charge of less than 1000 molecules, we dissolved μM amounts hexacyanoferrate(iii) in the aqueous continuous phase. The biphasic reaction between hexacyanoferrate(iii) and Cp2*(Fe)II allows for a feedback loop when the microelectrode is biased sufficiently negative to reduce Cp2*(Fe)III. This feedback loop, a typical EC′ catalytic mechanism, amplifies the electrochemical signal of Cp2*(Fe)II when the droplet is of small enough dimensions for feedback to occur. Our results demonstrate that clever biphasic reactions can be coupled with dissolving microdroplets to access extremely low limits of quantitation in electroanalysis.",

This study is significant in that it identifies the necessity of aggregate risk assessments by comparing the individual and aggregate risks of VOCs and identifying major exposure pathways. Based on the findings, it is deemed necessary to establish management strategies focusing on the primary exposure pathways to protect the health of residents living near the Sinpyeong and Jangrim industrial complexes. Furthermore, the results have potential value in informing broader air pollutant emission control and air quality management strategies for the entire Saha-gu district of Busan.\n          \n            Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "While anaerobic digestion (AD) has been employed for the degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, the associated digester performance might suffer from volatile fatty acids accumulation, insufficient substrate-microbes interaction, and lower biogas yields. To overcome these limitations, this study is the first to augment the hydrocarbon-degrading microbial capacities by adding agricultural waste-based biochar to the digestion medium. 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) was selected as the target pollutant because it is discharged in large quantities from oil refining, petrochemical, and chemical industries, causing serious environmental and human health concerns. A multi-chamber anaerobic reactor (MAR) was operated at a 1,2-DCA loading rate of 1.13 g/L/d, glucose dosage (as an electron donor) range of 200–700 mg/L, and hydraulic retention time of 11.2 h, giving dechlorination = 32.2 ± 6.9% and biogas yield = 210 ± 30 mL/g CODremoved. These values increased after biochar supplementation (100 mg/g volatile solids, VS, as an inoculum carrier) up to 60.2 ± 11.5% and 290 ± 40 mL/g CODremoved, respectively, owing to the enhancement of dehydrogenase enzyme activities. Burkholderiales (15.3%), Clostridiales (2.3%), Bacteroidales (3.5%), Xanthomonadales (3.3%), and Rhodobacterales (6.1%) involved in 1,2-DCA degradation were dominant in the reactor supplemented with biochar. It's suggested that biochar played a major role in facilitating the direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens, where chloride, ethylene glycol, and acetate derived from 1,2-DCA dechlorination could be further used to promote methanogenesis and methane production. The synergetic effect of adsorption and dechlorination towards 1,2-DCA removal was validated at various biochar dosages (50–120 mg/g) and 1,2-DCA concentrations (50–1000 mg/L). The techno-economic results showed that the cost of treating 1,2-DCA-laden discharge (100 m3/d) by the MAR module could be 0.83 USD/m3 with a payback period of 6.24 years (NPV = 2840 USD and IRR = 10%), retrieving profits from pollution reduction (9542 USD/yr), biogas selling (10418 USD/yr), and carbon credit (10294 USD/yr).",

    "abstract": "Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tailored functionalities hold great promise in diverse applications, but the key to realize their full advantages of highly ordered pore structures is the development of membrane fabrication approaches. In this work, we report a potential difference-modulated biphasic strategy to fabricate large-area, self-standing COF membranes under ambient conditions. The fabrication was conducted at the polarized water/1,2-dichloroethane (water/DCE) interface, where HCl was dissolved in water as a catalyst and monomers (both amine and aldehyde) were added to DCE. The external polarization of the water/DCE interface by cyclic voltammetry can continuously pump H+ from water to DCE to boost the Schiff base reaction of monomers and the growth of COF membranes. Moreover, the growth process can be real-time-monitored by interfacial double-layer capacitance measurement, and the permeability of COF membranes can be in situ-examined by heterogeneous ion transfer voltammetry. Given that the potential difference across the water/DCE interface can be also facilely modulated by dissolving proper electrolyte ions in two phases, the fabrication of large-area COF membranes is made possible in beakers. Using this strategy and different monomers, three types of centimeter-scale, free-standing COF membranes with tunable pore size and surface functionality were prepared, and their defect-free structure was proved by the molecular permeance and ultrafiltration test. We believe that this biphasic strategy offers a controllable and scalable way to fabricate COF membranes and sheds light on development of novel self-supporting membranes with unique functions.",

However, the agglomeration of single metal atoms and the use of inactive additives for affixing powdery SACs on planar electrodes may reduce the density of active sites, diminish the charge transport to active sites, and thus suppress their performance. Herein, a series of metal–nitrogen–carbon single‐atom aerogels (M‐SAAs, M: Cu, Ni, Au, Ru) are synthesized via a universal strategy, in which the merits of metal organic frameworks and carbon aerogels are perfectly combined to prevent the agglomeration of single metal atoms and overcome the problem of poor electrical conductivity. The as‐prepared M‐SAAs can be directly employed as self‐supporting electrodes for the electrochemical dechlorination of 1,2‐dichloroethane, and outstanding activity and stability are observed. Significantly, the Cu‐SAA with abundant Cu−N4 sites shows an extraordinarily high ethylene production rate of 446 µmol h−1, with a selectivity of 99% and Faradaic efficiency of 64%. Moreover, theoretical calculations are performed to demonstrate the selectivity and activity of different metal active sites.

An analysis of the effect of the BSA concentration on the \n transients enables to establish the adsorption isotherm, and to evaluate both the maximum surface excess concentration of BSA and the standard Gibbs energy of adsorption. An increase of the potential E results in an acceleration of the adsorption, and an increase of the surface excess concentration of the positively charged BSA at pH 2, while the latter effect is absent when BSA is charged negatively at pH 7.3. It is shown that the adsorbed BSA has a negligible effect on both the interfacial capacitance of the polarized water/DCE interface and the rate constant of the interfacial transfer of the tetraethylammonium (TEA+) or Cs+ ion measured at the corresponding standard ion transfer potential.",

The sign and potential dependence of the spikes reflect the charge and lipophilicity of the ionic load of the droplets.

One simple approach to chiralize an achiral MOF-structure that cannot be directly chiralized using a chiral secondary agent like 4-hydroxy-l-proline. Therefore, this chiral catalyst was synthesized with a simple and multistep method. Accordingly, Fe3O4@SiO2@UiO-66-NH2 has been synthesized via Fe3O4 modification with tetraethyl orthosilicate and subsequently with ZrCl4 and 2-aminoterephthalic acid. The presence of the silica layer helps to stabilize the Fe3O4 core, while the bonding between Zr4+ and the -OH groups in the silica layer promotes the development of Zr-MOFs on the Fe3O4 surface, and then the surfaces of the synthesized magnetic MOFs composite are functionalized with 1,2-dichloroethane and Cu(II) complex with 4-hydroxy-l-proline, [Cu(l-proline)2] to afford the magnetically chiral nanocatalyst.

    "abstract": "For many work situations only insufficient exposure data are available to perform proper risk assessment. Because measuring worker exposure can be time consuming and resource intense, the availability of reliable exposure models is important when performing risk assessments. However, the development and improvement of exposure models are hampered by scarcity of sound exposure data as well as by lack of information on relevant exposure factors and conditions of exposure. This paper describes a study where inhalation and dermal exposure data were collected under defined conditions. Exposure scenarios examined included tasks that have not been investigated in previous validation studies. The results of these measurements were compared with ECETOC TRA model version 3.1 predictions. In this study, five exposure scenarios were selected, namely 'use in a closed batch process' (PROC 4), 'mixing or blending in a partly open batch process' (PROC 5), 'rolling' (PROC 10), 'immersion' (PROC 13), and 'stirring' (PROC 19). These PROCs stem from the descriptors that Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals has established to depict the identified uses of chemical substances. These exposure scenarios were selected mainly because little or no data are available for these situations, or ECETOC TRA is likely to underestimate exposure for these situations. Experiments were performed by volunteers for the selected exposure scenarios, in which tasks were performed aiming to represent real workplace situations. In total 70 experiments were performed, during which 70 dermal exposure measurements (5 volunteers × 2 repeats × 7 scenarios) and 32 inhalation exposure measurements (4 volunteers × 2 repeats × 4 scenarios) were collected. Two formulations were used, namely pure Tinopal SWN powder (solid product, a fluorescent tracer) and 0.5% Tinopal SWN dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). DCE is considered a moderate volatile liquid. For exposure scenarios using the liquid formulation, both inhalation and dermal measurements were performed, while for exposure scenarios using the pure powder only dermal exposure measurements were performed. In addition, photographs were taken under ultraviolet light to qualitatively assess exposure patterns on hands and body. Volunteers repeatedly performed a selection of tasks under standardized conditions in a test chamber for each exposure scenario. Results show that ECETOC TRA overestimated dermal hand exposure for all PROCs included in the study, and was considered to be conservative. Additionally, ECETOC TRA overestimated inhalation exposure for closed and partially closed processes, but underestimated inhalation exposure for rolling and handling of immersed objects. Qualitative assessment of the hands and body showed mainly the hands were exposed for tasks involving closed and partially closed processes and when handling of immersed objects. Exposure to other body segments were also observed for rolling and stirring. In conclusion, this study gave insights into dermal and inhalation exposure levels during selected task scenarios, and showed that ECETOC TRA is conservative when dermal exposure is estimated. Inhalation exposure estimates for PROCs 10 and 13 tasks with the moderate volatility liquid were underestimated in this study. It may be therefore necessary to re-evaluate base model predictions for these scenarios when medium fugacity liquids are involved.",

    "abstract": "Dehydrochlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) is an important oil-based way for the industrial production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), but has proved to be plagued by a high operating temperature and low efficiency. Therefore, environmentally friendly and metal-free catalysts are in high demand for green chemical processes. In view of the stronger electronegativity of borazine (B3N3) and convenience of constructing a two-dimensional structure because of the coplanarity of B3N3, the acetenyl group, and the benzene ring, herein, we report a novel controllable B3N3 doped activated carbon (B,N-ACs) synthesized using B3N3-containing arylacetylene resin for dehydrochlorination of 1,2-DCE. The result is activated carbon loaded with B3N3-doped carbon nanosheets on the surface due to the B3N3-containing arylacetylene resin grown on the surface of activated carbons. The B,N-ACs deliver excellent catalytic performance, with a 1,2-DCE conversion of ∼92.0% and VCM selectivity over 99.9% at 250 °C, significantly higher than that of the current catalysts in the industry. The results further verified that pyridinic-N and the internal B3N3 play significant roles in this catalysis. The new green, metal-free B,N-ACs with excellent catalytic efficiency make it a promising catalyst for dehydrochlorination of 1,2-DCE to produce VCM.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive study on essential oil and different solvent extracts of Sideritis romana L. subsp. purpurea (Tal. ex Benth.) Heywood (Lamiaceae) from Montenegro is reported. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the essential oil revealed a total of 43 components with bicyclogermacrene (23.8%), germacrene D (8%), (E)-caryophyllene (7.9%) and spathulenol (5.5%) as the major ones. Sesquiterpenoid group was found to be the most dominant one (64.8%), with 19.9% of the oxygenated forms. In the crude methanol extract of the investigated plant, obtained by Sohhlet exraction, the total phenol content was 14.7 ± 0.4 mg of GA/g, the total flavonoids were 0.29 ± 0.03% expressed as hyperoside percentage, whereas the total tannins content was 0.22 ± 0.04% expressed as pyrogallol percentage. For the antimicrobial activity determination, the following microorganisms have been used: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 29213)) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA (clinical strain)), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), carbapenem-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae (clinical strain), carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (clinical strain) and Candida albicans (ATCC 14053). The essential oil showed high potency against MSSA and MRSA, both at high (~5 × 105 CFU/mL) and low (~5 × 103 CFU/mL) inoculum. With respect to MSSA, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value was 0.307 mg/mL, with bactericidal activity obtained at 0.615 mg/mL, while, in the case of MRSA, the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were 0.076 and 0.153 mg/mL, respectively. Regarding anti-Candida albicans activity, the MIC value was 2.46 mg/mL without reaching fungicidal activity. In addition to the observed essential oil efficacy, different solvent extracts were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity. Similarly to the essential oil, thehighest efficacy was observed against both MSSA and MRSA strains, at high and low inoculums, in the case of the 1,2-dichloroethane and methanol extracts. A potent fungicidal activity has been also found for the n-hexane and 1,2-dichloroethane extracts. It can be concluded that Sideritis romana L. subsp. purpurea (Tal. ex Benth.)

Molecular dynamics simulations were thus performed to describe the mechanism of transfer of the hydrophobic anion tetraphenylborate (TPB-) from a 1,2-dichloroethane (organic) phase to an aqueous phase under the action of an external electric field. The anion migrated to the protein at the interface, establishing multiple complexes involving both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The sidechains of positively charged Lys and Arg residues formed strong electrostatic interactions with the anion. Non-polar residues like Trp, Met and Val formed hydrophobic interactions with the anion as it moved along the protein surface. During this process, lysozyme adopted various distinct, partially unfolded conformations at the interface, all involving multiple anion-protein complexes with small free energy barriers between them. In summary, the mechanism of protein-facilitated ion-transfer at a polarized liquid-liquid interface involves the movement of a hydrophobic anion along the protein surface through a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.",

    "abstract": "The Junggar Basin in Xinjiang is located in the hinterland of Eurasia, where the groundwater is a significant resource and has important ecological functions. The introduction of harmful organic pollutants into groundwater from increasing human activities and rapid socioeconomic development may lead to groundwater pollution at various levels. Therefore, to develop an effective regulatory framework, establishing a list of priority control organic pollutants (PCOPs) is in urgent need. In this study, a method of ranking the priority of pollutants based on their prevalence (Pv), occurrence (O) and persistent bioaccumulative toxicity (PBT) has been developed. PvOPBT in the environment was applied in the screening of PCOPs among 34 organic pollutants and the risk assessment of screened PCOPs in groundwater in the Junggar Basin. The results show that the PCOPs in groundwater were benzo[a]pyrene, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloromethane and DDT. Among the pollutants, benzo[a]pyrene, 1,2-dichloroethane and DDT showed high potential ecological risk, whilst trichloromethane represented low potential ecological risk. With the exception of benzo[a]pyrene, which had high potential health risks, the other screened PCOPs had low potential health risks. Unlike the scatter distribution of groundwater benzo[a]pyrene, the 1,2-dichloroethane and trichloromethane in groundwater were mainly concentrated in the central part of the southern margin and the northern margin of the Junggar Basin, while the DDT in groundwater was only distributed in Jinghe County (in the southwest) and Beitun City (in the north).

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This research assesses how effectively alkaline-activated persulfate removes 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) and trichloroethylene (TCE) from groundwater, while examining the underlying mechanisms. The results show that while the degradation efficiency of 1,2-DCA (4.2 × 10-4 M) ranges from 42 to 96%, TCE (4.2 × 10-4 M) is completely degraded by persulfate (4.2 × 10-2 M) after 120 h. The alkaline conditions (pH &gt; 11) improve the degradation of 1,2-DCA but hinder TCE breakdown, leading to the formation of vinyl chloride through dehydrochlorination of 1,2-DCA. The degradation patterns for 1,2-DCA and TCE align with pseudo-first-order kinetics. The highest rate constant for 1,2-DCA oxidation is 6.3 × 10-6 s-1 at pH 13 whereas the highest rate constant for TCE removal is 2.5 × 10-5 s-1 at pH 3. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis reveals the presence of both SO4\n            -· and ·OH in the alkaline-activated persulfate system. Although alkaline persulfate generates more sulfate radicals and highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals, the elevated pH reduces oxidation reduction potential (ORP), which limits contaminant removal. For each unit increase in pH, the ORP value decreases by approximately 49.9 mV. Additionally, the presence of chloride (0.05-0.40 M) and carbonate (0.01-0.27 M) diminishes the degradation rates of both pollutants, with carbonate having a more substantial inhibitory effect under alkaline conditions. When both 1,2-DCA and TCE are present, alkaline conditions suppress TCE degradation, and acidic conditions reduce 1,2-DCA removal. This study highlights the importance of pH, ORP, and anion interactions in the effectiveness of alkaline-activated persulfate in treating chlorinated organic compounds in groundwater.",

Therefore, we investigated the effect of the addition of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), a co-solvent with low electron-donating ability, on the electrochemical properties of graphite in a concentrated PC-based electrolyte solution. An effective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was formed, and lithium intercalation into graphite occurred in the concentrated PC-based electrolyte solutions containing various amounts of DCE, while the reversible capacity improved. Raman spectroscopy results confirmed that the solvation structure of the lithium ions, which allows for effective SEI formation, was maintained despite the decrease in the total molality of LiPF6 by the addition of DCE.

    "abstract": "The asymmetric and catalytic Michael reaction between α-nitroesters and nitroalkenes has been studied in the presence of two bifunctional catalysts both containing the same absolute chirality at the carbon backbone. The reaction performed in similar conditions allows us to control the syn or anti selectivity of the Michael adduct obtaining good yields and high enantiocontrol in all cases. Introduction The absolute stereochemistry of a molecule has a paramount influence on the properties that this compound will have when interacting with biological systems [1]. As a consequence, the last decades have witnessed an enormous progress directed toward the development of synthetic methodology for the preparation of chiral molecules as single enantiomers with a well-defined three-dimensional arrangement. In this scenario, asymmetric catalysis arises as a key methodology for chemical production of enantiomerically enriched chiral compounds in terms of atom economy and reduced waste generation [2-6]. Nowadays, many very effective methodologies exist that allow the formation of a chiral compound as a single enantiomer. However, and despite the advances made in the field, an important challenge arises when a molecule containing multiple stereocentres has to be prepared because the access to all possible stereoisomers is not usually straightforward. While obtaining one or other mirror image of the target molecule can also be easily achieved by selecting the correct enantiomer of the catalyst, the relative configuration is typically governed by intrinsic factors associated to the mechanistic profile of the reaction and very often the formation of the major diastereoisomer is determined from the very beginning of the reaction and Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 2015, 11, 2577–2583. 2578 therefore access to any stereoisomer at will from the same set of starting materials with full absolute and relative stereocontrol is not trivial. Previous reports show that the diastereoselection can be directed by different approaches that include the modification of reaction conditions [7-9], the incorporation of additives or co-catalysts [10-13], the modification of some structural features of the substrate [14,15], the use of two catalysts that are structurally different to each other and that can also operate independently through a single transition state with minimal matched/mismatched interactions [16-22] or finally the concurrent use of two cycle-specific catalysts, in which each of them is exclusively involved in the formation of one stereocentre and therefore has to overcome the stereochemical bias exerted by the stereocentres generated in the previous steps [23-26]. In this context, we have recently reported a catalytic and enantioselective Michael/Michael cascade reaction in which α-nitro-δ-ketoesters react with nitroalkenes to provide densely functionalized cyclohexanes in excellent yield and stereoselectivity (Scheme 1) [27]. This reaction made use of bifunctional tertiary amine/squaramide catalysts [28-32] and, interestingly, we found that catalysts containing the same backbone chirality provided different diastereoisomers, thus allowing the development of a diastereodivergent process. Scheme 1: Diastereodivergent cascade Michael/Michael reaction using catalysts with the same absolute chirality reported in our group. In this report, we wish to present the extension of this behaviour to the Michael reaction between α-substituted nitroacetates and nitroalkenes. The Michael reaction is regarded as a fundamental tool for the formation of C–C bonds during the synthesis of complex molecules [33-35], in particular, being able to control both the simple and the facial stereoselection of those versions in which two stereocentres are generated in the reaction become of special utility to synthetic chemists. In this case, using two different bifunctional tertiary amine/squaramide organocatalysts [36-61] with the same absolute chirality, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction can be controlled to provide the corresponding Michael adducts with two stereocentres, one of them being quaternary, and allowing the preparation of the desired diastereoisomer at will. Results and Discussion We started our work by first applying the conditions optimized for our recently reported cascade process to the reaction between ethyl 2-nitropropanoate (1a) and β-nitrostyrene (2a). As it can be seen in Scheme 2, the use of catalyst 4 led to the formation of the syn-diastereoisomer syn-3a in excellent yield, an acceptable 88:12 dr and 98% ee. As expected, the use of the pseudoenantiomeric catalyst 5 provided the corresponding enantiomer ent-syn-3a with similar results. Moving to cyclohexanediamine-based catalyst 6 resulted in the same behaviour as observed in our previous report, isolating the other possible diastereoisomer anti-3a in good yield, 88:12 dr and 90% ee. Once we had confirmed the good performance of the reaction in this intermolecular Michael reaction, we proceeded to evaluate the scope of this transformation in order to establish whether this method could be useful and general for a variety of nitroalkene Michael acceptors and nitroacetate donors. For this reason, we initially studied the reaction using squaramide 4 as catalyst that leads to the formation of syn-3 adducts. In this sense, and as it can be seen in Table 1, the reaction performed excellently in almost all the cases studied. In particular, when the reaction was conducted using nitrostyrene derivatives as Michael acceptors, the corresponding adducts 3a–k were isolated cleanly, in high yields, diastereoand enantioselectivities regardless the electronic nature of the aromatic substituent of the nitrostyrene reagent. Indeed, the reaction using nitrostyrenes containing electron-donating groups at any of the position of the aryl ring led to the formation of the corresponding adducts (syn-3a–f) in excellent yield, good diastereoselectivities and enantiomeric excesses over 95% (Table 1, entries 2–6). When nitrostyrenes containing electron-withdrawing groups were tested, the reaction proceeded equally well (Table 1, entries 7–11), although a slight decrease in the yield was observed for those cases in which the substituent was placed at the ortho-position (Table 1, entries 7 and 10). Heteroaromatic substituents at the nitroalkene reagent were also tested and Beilstein J. Org.

However, ZVI is incapable of dechlorinating 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), a commonly found contaminant in groundwater, and the existing ZVI modification methods have little effect on this predicament. In this study, we prepared ZVI composites modified with Fe-N4 coordination structure (Fe0@FeNC), which exhibited outstanding dechlorination performance toward 1,2-DCA. Fe0@FeNC (1 g/L) can degrade 94% of 1,2-DCA (10 mg/L) within 37 days, with an ethene selectivity of nearly 100%, whereas nanoscale ZVI (nZVI) or even Pd-doped nZVI and sulfidated ZVI cannot degrade 1,2-DCA. The results from X-ray diffraction patterns and Mössbauer spectra confirmed the presence of Fe0 and Fe-N4 coordination structure in the Fe0@FeNC, which were proven to be the electron donor and dechlorination active center for 1,2-DCA dechlorination, respectively. Theoretical calculation reveals that the Fe-N4 coordination structure can reduce the free energy required for 1,2-DCA reduction, thus allowing 1,2-DCA to utilize electrons provided by Fe0 to achieve dechlorination. These findings can guide the design of ZVI-based materials to achieve in situ abiotic remediation of 1,2-DCA-contaminated groundwater.",

In the present study, we established a DCE-exposed animal model by inhalation in SD rats and used HepG2 cells in in vitro tests. The DCE-exposed groups showed hepatic dysfunction relative to the control group. Moreover, apoptotic cells and decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were found in liver tissue of rats in 3 DCE-exposed groups. In vitro tests showed that short-term exposure to DCE induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the incubation of cells with DCE significantly decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, incubating HepG2 cells with epidermal growth factor, an ERK1/2 activator, significantly increased apoptosis in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that DCE induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by inhibiting ERK1/2 pathways.",

In this study, the controllability of the BFHP-ED process for separating the azeotropic mixture of n-hexane and 1,2-dichloroethane is investigated by presenting three temperature control schemes and two temperature difference control schemes. The dynamic simulation results demonstrate that the integration with the feed-forward structure and pressure-compensation action can significantly enhance the performance of the temperature control schemes to resist disturbances in feed flow rate. The temperature difference control structures are effective in resisting disturbances in feed composition, and the performance can be further improved by regulating the flow rate ratio of the entrainer to the feed stream (S/F) using a temperature controller that is cascaded with a high selector. Consequently, the temperature difference control schemes in the extractive distillation column with pressure compensation action and a high selector for regulating S/F exhibit the best performance by achieving smaller transient deviations, setting times and integral absolute errors, and maintaining the purities of the two products around the desired values with a maximum steady-state offset of ± 0.08 %.",

The quantitative 13C-NMR analysis revealed the presence of two position isomers. The electronic structure of the DPyDB-CN-18C6 molecule was characterized by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies in four solvents with different polarities to observe particular behavior of isomers, as well as to demonstrate a possible non-bonding chemical association (such as ground- and excited-state associations, namely, to probe if there were forming dimers/excimers). The interpretation of the electronic structure was realized through QM calculations. The TD-CAM-B3LYP functional, at the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set, indicated the presence of predominant π → π* and mixed π → π* + n → π* transitions, in line with the UV-vis experimental data.

In particular, the WAXD analysis of powder and thin films obtained from n-hexane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and ethanol indicated an amorphous organization, whereas from toluene a smectic ordering was obtained.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The presence of abundant water vapor in industrial organic waste gases greatly reduces the selective adsorption of volatile organic pollutants (VOCs). The polarity of the adsorbent and VOC molecules plays an important role in the adsorption process, especially in the presence of water vapor. In this paper, commercial coconut shell activated carbon (CSC) was modified by a thermal reduction treatment to obtain heat-treated coconut shell activated carbon (HCSC). CSC and HCSC exhibited similar pore structure characteristics but differed significantly in surface oxygen content (10.97% and 7.55%, respectively). Dynamic adsorption breakthrough experiments were conducted to determine the dynamic adsorption capacities of toluene on both adsorbents under varying relative humidity levels. HCSC demonstrated superior toluene/water vapor adsorption selectivity. Further analyses of toluene adsorption kinetics, activation energy, and water vapor adsorption isotherms revealed that the lower surface oxygen functional group content of HCSC resulted in a weaker surface polarity, facilitating the adsorption of weakly polar toluene. This was attributed to stronger toluene–HCSC interactions and weaker water–HCSC interactions. The dynamic adsorption capacities of three VOCs with varying polarities were also tested on HCSC. The observed VOC/water vapor adsorption selectivity had the following order: toluene > n-heptane > 1,2-dichloroethane. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were employed to quantify the relationship between the adsorption selectivity of eight VOCs with varying polarities and their molecular polarity. The results indicated a decrease in adsorption selectivity with increasing VOC polarity. A mechanistic analysis suggests that more polar VOCs prefer to adsorb polar oxygen-containing functional groups, competing with water molecules for adsorption sites. Under high humidity, hydrogen bonding leads to the formation of water clusters, exacerbating this competition. This research holds significant implications for the efficient selective adsorption of VOCs with varying polarities in humid industrial conditions.",

Sample preparation was based on protein precipitation and liquid-liquid extraction using 1,2-dichloroethane. Chromatographic separation of TIG and minocycline (internal standard, IS) was achieved on an Atlantis T3 column (150 mm × 3.0 mm, 3.0 μm) using gradient elution. The selected reaction monitoring transitions were performed at 293.60 m/z → 257.10 m/z for TIG and 458.00 m/z → 441.20 m/z for IS.

Results indicated that under EF, DCE degradation on CeO₂ occurs through a mixed mechanism, including Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L–H) via electronic conduction and Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) through lattice oxygen migration, with all DCE activation and oxidation steps accelerated by EF. For 10 W/CeO₂, DCE degradation primarily follows the L–H mechanism due to enhanced interfacial electronic effects. EF improves O₂ activation at interfacial oxygen vacancies and strengthens DCE dechlorination on polarized Brønsted acidic sites at WOₓ/CeO₂ interfaces. The presence of water vapor further enhanced the performance of CeO₂-based catalysts within EF by altering H₂O adsorption-activation and providing more active oxygen or protons for reaction involvement.

    "doi": "10.1111/gwmr.12607",

    "abstract": "Complex mixtures of contaminants at hazardous waste sites often pose significant challenges for remediation. For example, within the largest industrial area in northeastern Brazil, one of the sites is contaminated with at least 26 chemicals, six of which are present in the part per million range: chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2‐dichlorobenzene (1,2‐DCB), 4‐nitrotoluene (4‐NT), 2,6‐dinitrotoluene (2,6‐DNT), 4‐isopropylaniline (4‐IPA), and 1,2‐dichloroethane (1,2‐DCA). Other chemicals of concern include 2,4‐dinitrotoluene (2,4‐DNT), 2‐ and 3‐nitrotoluene (NT), and 1,4‐dioxane. The objective of this study was to evaluate remediation strategies that include aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation, along with chemical reduction and oxidation. In microcosms prepared with site soil and groundwater, aerobic biodegradation of CB, 1,2‐DCB, 2‐NT, 3‐NT, and 4‐NT was demonstrated, while the dinitrotoluene isomers, 1,2‐DCA, and 1,4‐dioxane were recalcitrant. 2,6‐DNT, 2,4‐DNT, and 4‐NT were readily reduced to amino‐toluenes under anaerobic conditions by microbes with lactate serving as the electron donor or using zero valent iron. Amino‐toluenes were amenable to chemical oxidation and/or aerobic biodegradation. This suggests a sequential treatment strategy may be the most effective remediation approach, consisting of aerobic biodegradation, followed by anaerobic reduction (abiotic or biotic) and then aerobic biodegradation and/or chemical oxidation. This approach was the most effective in a continuous flow column experiment using site soil. Batch tests with mixtures of contaminants as well as groundwater exposed to chemical oxidation revealed modest to no inhibitory effects. While these mixtures may slow the rate of biodegradation, a remediation strategy that incorporates aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation is achievable.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Background 1,2-Dichloroethane is a commonly used industrial solvent. Acute or subacute occupational exposure can cause toxic encephalopathy; however, long-term changes in brain imaging are not frequently documented. Case presentation A 39-year-old woman developed dizziness and forgetfulness 9 days after performing glue coating. Her symptoms improved significantly after a 7-day break from work. However, after resuming work for 3 days, she returned with dizziness, headache, and anxiety. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive edema and diffuse abnormal signal intensities in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, and bilateral cerebral white matter. She was treated with salvianolate injection, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate, and neurotrophic therapy. Two weeks after admission, her symptoms improved significantly, except for mild uncoordinated walking. The range of abnormal MRI signals remained consistent with previous findings. She was discharged the following day. She experienced worsened headache 3 days later. Computed tomography revealed diffuse cerebral edema. Despite treatment with mannitol, her headache rapidly worsened and was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, hypertension, bradycardia, and dyspnea, ultimately leading to unconsciousness. Follow-up MRI showed findings similar to the previous scan, except that the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequence had changed from hypointense to hyperintense. Shortly after the MRI examination, she experienced respiratory arrest. Unfortunately, she died 32 days after her initial admission due to severe cerebral injury and infection. Conclusion Occupational exposure to 1,2-dichloroethane can lead to toxic encephalopathy, presenting as diffuse progressive cerebral edema. This case shows that brain imaging findings may not always correlate with the patient’s clinical condition, so careful monitoring is essential.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "\n Background1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) is a synthetic organic chemical that causes brain edema under subacute poisoning. Our previous studies indicated that the neuroinflammation could be induced due to activation of both astrocytes and microglia during the course of brain edema in 1,2-DCE intoxicated mice. However, the crosstalk between the two glial cells in 1,2-DCE-induced neuroinflammation is unclear. In the current studies, we hypothesized that astrocytes are the first responder to the effects of 1,2-DCE in the brain, as they adhere to the cerebral capillaries, and they are an essential component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).MethodsWe used primary cultured rat astrocytes and microglia, as well as a highly aggressively proliferating immortalized (HAPI) microglia cell line to study the effects of astrocytes on microglia polarization following exposure to 2-CE.ResultsFindings from the present studies demonstrated that treatment of primary rat astrocytes with 2-chloroethanol (2-CE), the intermediate metabolite of 1,2-DCE in vivo, can stimulate the activation of A1 reactive astrocytes (A1s) through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/ nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathways by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during 2-CE metabolism. A1s activated by 2-CE can upregulate the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and stimulate the M1 polarization of microglia through IL-1β and TNF-α released by 2-CE activated A1s. Microglia are less sensitive to 2-CE than astrocytes, since treatment of primary rat microglia with 30 mM 2-CE alone failed to activate them, though this dose of 2-CE can activate A1s and in turn stimulate M1 polarization of microglia through the factors released by A1s.ConclusionThe neuroinflammation induced by 1,2-DCE in the brain of mice is most probably triggered by the activation of astrocytes. The understanding of the multidimensional roles of reactive astrocytes may further the development of new treatment strategies in reducing neuroinflammation and brain edema following 1,2-DCE-induced toxic encephalopathy.",

The effect of soil composition on the available oxidant demand and CVOC removal rate was evaluated. Results suggest that the treatment efficiency of CVOCs in soil can be ranked as follows: cis-1,2-dichloroethene &amp;gt; trichloroethylene &amp;gt; 1,2-dichloroethane &amp;gt; 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The reactions of soil components with persulfate, shown by the reduction in soil phase natural organics and mineral content, occurred in parallel with persulfate oxidation of CVOCs. Natural oxidant demand from the reaction of soil components with persulfate exerted a large relative contribution to the total oxidant demand. The main influencing factor in oxidant demand in paddy-soil-persulfate systems was natural organics, rather than mineral content as seen with sand and clay soil types exposed to the persulfate system. The competition between CVOCs and soil components for oxidation by persulfate indicates that soil composition exhibits a considerable influence on the available oxidant demand and CVOC removal efficiency. Therefore, soil composition of natural organics and mineral content is a critical factor in estimating the oxidation efficiency of in-situ remediation systems.",

The reactions of a naphthalene complex [CpRu(η6-C10H8)]PF6 (Cp = η5-C5H5) with 5-R-3-(pyrid-2-yl)pyrazoles (R-LH; R = Ph, CF3) in acetonitrile afforded the starting metal-ligand bifunctional ruthenium complexes [CpRu(R-LH)(MeCN)]PF6 (1a, R = Ph; 1b, R = CF3) featuring an N-N chelate protic pyrazole. The treatment of the CF3-substituted pyrazole complex 1b with 3 in 1,2-dichloroethane at 50 °C resulted in the formation of the η3-butadienyl complex 5. Meanwhile, the corresponding reaction of the phenylpyrazole complex 1a in 1,4-dioxane at 90 °C gave the N-allenylmethylpyrazole complex 6. The C-O and C-H bond cleavage of 3 in these reactions can be ascribed to the metal-ligand cooperation: initial formation of an η3-propargyl complex assisted by NHO hydrogen bonding and following C-H deprotonation by the neighboring pyrazolato ligand. On the other hand, in boiling methanol, the protic pyrazole complex 1a catalyzed the C-O bond cleavage of 3, which resulted in catalytic isomerization of 3 to an α,β-unsaturated enone, 3-methyl-1-phenylbut-2-en-1-one (8).

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Photocatalytic molecular conversions that lead to value-added chemicals are of considerable interest. To achieve highly efficient photocatalytic reactions, it is equally important as it is challenging to construct systems that enable effective charge separation. Here, we demonstrate that the rational construction of a biphasic solution system with a ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple enables efficient photocatalysis by spatial charge separation using the liquid-liquid interface. In a single-phase system, exposure of a 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) solution containing a Ru(II)- or Ir(III)-based photosensitizer, Fc, and benzyl bromide (Bn-Br) to visible-light irradiation failed to generate any product. However, the photolysis in a H2O/DCE biphasic solution, where the compounds are initially distributed in the DCE phase, facilitated the reductive coupling of Bn-Br to dibenzyl (Bn2) using Fc as an electron donor. The key result of this study is that Fc+, generated by photooxidation of Fc in the DCE phase, migrates to the aqueous phase due to the drastic change in its partition coefficient compared to that of Fc. This liquid-liquid phase migration of the mediator is essential for facilitating the reduction of Bn-Br in the DCE phase as it suppresses backward charge recombination. The co-existence of anions can further modify the driving force of phase migration of Fc+ depending on their hydrophilicity; the best photocatalytic activity was obtained with a turnover frequency of 79.5 h-1 and a quantum efficiency of 0.2% for the formation of Bn2 by adding NBu4+Br- to the biphasic solution.

The study involves the calculations of hazard indexes related to everyday use of water from the water distribution system by children and for adults. The materials comprise the results of analyses of processed water conducted in the years 2012–2019. The analyses involved determining the contents of benzo(a)pyrene, benzene, acrylamide, epichlorohydrin, vinyl chloride and the chlorinated volatile compound – 1,2‑dichloroethane (for a total of 98 deter‑ minations). The study was conducted on a water supply system operating in accordance with the regulations in force at the time of the study. The obtained results of determinations for all VOCs were significantly lower than the permissible concentrations in water, close to the limit of quantitation (LOQ = from 10 –4 to 10 –6 ). The results obtained allowed for calculating the maxi‑ mum non‑carcinogenic hazard index for the inhalation exposure (HI inhal ) to the xenobiotics studied which amounted to 3.03E‑03 in children and 2.86E‑02 in adults which is equal to 0.3% and 2.9% of the permissible exposure level respectively (HI perm ). The carcinogenic risk index for the inhalation exposure (CR inhal ) to benzo(a)pyrene and benzene through contact with tap water amounted to 1.57E‑09 which is equal to 0.16% of the permissible value (CR perm ). It was found that adults are at a greater risk of being affected by VOCs than children because of greater inhalation rate and longer exposure duration.

    "abstract": "Cu nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown to be excellent electrocatalysts, particularly for CO_2 reduction – a critical reaction for sequestering anthropogenic, atmospheric carbon. Herein, the micro interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) is exploited for the simultaneous electropolymerization of 2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (TT) and reduction of Cu^2+ to Cu nanoparticles (NPs) generating a flexible electrocatalytic composite electrode material. TT acts as an electron donor in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) through heterogeneous electron transfer across the water|DCE (w|DCE) interface to CuSO_4 dissolved in water. The nanocomposite formation process was probed using cyclic voltammetry as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CV and EIS data show that the film forms quickly; however, the interfacial reaction is not spontaneous and does not proceed without an applied potential. At high [TT] the heterogeneous electron transfer wave was recorded voltammetrically but not at low [TT]. However, probing the edge of the polarizable potential window was found to be sufficient to initiate electrogeneration/electropolymerization. SEM and TEM were used to image and analyze the final Cu NP/poly-TT composites and it was discovered that there is a concomitant decrease in NP size with increasing [TT]. Preliminary electrocatalysis results at a nanocomposite modified large glassy carbon electrode saw a > 2 × increase in CO_2 reduction currents versus an unmodified electrode. These data suggest that this strategy is a promising means of generating electrocatalytic materials for carbon capture.

It is based on the color reaction of Co2+ with 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-dimethylaminoaniline (5-Br-PADMA) in a Britton–Robinson buffer solution at pH 6.0 to form stable hydrophobic chelates, which were separated and enriched by DLLME with 1,2-dichloroethane (CH2ClCH2Cl) as extraction and acetonitrile (CH3CN) as a dispersive solvent. The sedimented phase containing the chelates is then determined with GFAAS. Parameters that affect extraction efficiency, such as types and volumes of extraction and disperser solvents, pH of sample solution, extraction time, concentration of the chelating agent 5-Br-PADMA, and salt effect, were investigated. Under optimal conditions, the calibration graph was linear over the range 0.05–1.0 ng/mL, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9922 and a detection limit of 0.03 ng/mL. Preconcentration factor (PF) is calculated as the ratio of the aqueous solution volume (5 mL) to that of the organic phase volume (40 μL), and enrichment factor (EF) is calculated as the ratio of the slopes of the calibration graphs obtained with and without DLLME for 5.0 mL of sample solution, which were 120 and 112.5, respectively. The extraction efficiency, calculated by EF/PF·100, was 93.8%. The relative standard deviation (RSD) at the 0.5 ng/mL Co2+ level was 3.8% (n = 6).

    "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measurements during the worst air quality season of 2020–2022 were conducted at three distinct sites within Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan’s largest harbor and a significant hub in Asia. Air VOCs samples were collected continuously in 24 h by canister and analyzed by GC/MS with pre-concentration systems according to U.S. EPA Method TO-15. The source apportionment was defined by diagnostic ratio analysis and positive matrix factorization (PMF) model while ozone formation potentials (OFP) were estimated by maximum incremental reactivity method. Health risk was estimated by unit risks and reference concentration for cancer and non-cancer risk, respectively. The results indicate a decrease in average total VOC (TVOC) concentrations (ppbv) over the study period: 37.9 ± 4.5 in 2020, 23.3 ± 9.9 in 2021, and 23.3 ± 2.6 in 2022. Dominant VOC components were C2-VOCs and aromatics, which made up more than 50% of TVOCs. According to diagnostic ratio analysis, local anthropogenic emissions, such as industrial and ship/vehicle emissions around harbor area, were main causes. Four sources were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF), with industrial activities (33.7%), followed by vehicle and ship emissions (30.6%), solvent usages (21.1%), and fuel evaporations (14.6%). OFP results indicated that toluene was primary OFP contributor, accounting for an average of 30.4%, followed by C2-VOCs at 16.2% and m/p-xylenes at 12.5%, collectively contributing nearly 60% to OFP. These OFP contributors were significantly attributed to vehicle/ship emissions and solvent usages. Cumulative non-carcinogenic hazard indices were less than 1 indicates an acceptable non-carcinogenic health concern. Notably, only 1,2-dichloroethane exceeded the threshold of 1.0 × 10-6 for carcinogenic risk throughout the three-year observation period, while 1,3-butadiene indicated a high risk only in 2020. Industrial emissions could mainly contribute to carcinogenic risks in Kaohsiung Harbor and the surrounding area.

    "abstract": "New insights are raised to interpret pathway complexity in the supramolecular assembly of chiral triarylamine tris‐amide (TATA) monomer. In cosolvent systems, the monomer undergoes entirely different assembly processes depending on the chemical feature of the two solvents. Specifically, 1,2‐dichloroethane (DCE) and methylcyclohexane (MCH) cosolvent trigger the cooperative growth of monomers with M helical arrangement, and hierarchical thin nanobelts are further formed. But in DCE and hexane (HE) combination, a different pathway occurs where monomers go through isodesmic growth to generate twisted nanofibers with P helical arrangement. Moreover, the two distinct assemblies exhibit opposite excited‐state chirality. The driving force for both assemblies is the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between amide moieties. However, the mechanistic investigation indicates that radical and neutral triarylamine species go through distinct assembly phases by changing solvent structures. The neutralization of radicals in MCH plays a critical role in pathway complexity, which significantly impacts the overall supramolecular assembly process, giving rise to inversed supramolecular helicity and distinct morphologies. This differentiation in pathways affected by radicals provides a new approach to manipulate chiral supramolecular assembly process by facile solvent–solute interactions.",

A tentative mechanism is proposed comprising (a) the diffusion-controlled transport of the ion-pairs (RCl)ip from the aqueous to the organic solvent phase providing a major contribution to the chloride extraction, (b) decomposition of the multiple ion-pairs or clusters (RCl)ipx, which are formed by agglomeration of the single ion-pairs (RCl)ip in the aqueous phase (w), and (c) the exponential decay of the ion-pairs (RCl)ip accumulated on the organic solvent side of the interface at the beginning of the OCP measurements. This model enables to simulate successfully the experimental time dependence of the chloride concentration. A conclusion is made that the effect of the composition of the organic solvent electrolyte RX, where X- = tetraphenylborate (TPB-) or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate (TB-), on the rate and extent of the anomalous accumulation of the chloride anion in the phase (o) of the two-phase liquid system LiCl(w)/RX(o) can be related to the hydrophobicity of the electrolytes RCl and RX. The latter property can be characterized by the standard Gibbs energy of transfer from the aqueous (w) to the organic solvent (o) phase. The accumulation of the chloride anion in the phase (o) appears to be promoted by the decreasing value of the transfer Gibbs energy of RCl in the sequence TBACl > TPeACl > THexACl > THepACl > BACl, while the decreasing value of the transfer Gibbs energy of RX in the sequence TBATPB > TPeATPB > THexATPB > THepATPB > BATPB > BATB starts to block the cycle combining the energetically unfavorable extraction of RX from the phase (o) to the phase (w) with the energetically favorable extraction of RCl in the opposite direction. IR spectroscopy provides evidence of the formation of the water clusters in the organic solvent phase equilibrated with the aqueous phase in the presence of the tetraalkylammonium cation in both phases, which are supposed to drive the anomalous accumulation of the chloride anion in the phase (o).",

Exposure to VOCs might lead to health effects such as sensory irritation, disorders of the nervous system, asthma, and cancer. The volatile organic compound data from twenty-four air permanent monitoring stations covering seven provinces obtained from the Pollution Control Department of Thailand (PCD) showed four out of 9 VOCs to be higher than the criteria level.\nObjective: This study aimed to assess the quantitative health risk from exposure to four selected VOCs, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, chloroform, and 1,2-dichloroethane, via inhalation.\nMethod: We performed the quantitative health risk assessment for the risk groups, including babies, children, and adults, who lived and worked near air monitoring stations via the inhalation route, following the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) method. We calculated the HQ (hazard quotient) for non-carcinogenic and the inhalation cancer risk for VOCs.\nResults: The HQ of 1,3-butadiene in Rayong ranged from 0.023 to 4.96 and 0.008 to 1.69 in adults and children, respectively. The calculated HQ was more significant than 1, indicating adverse health effects likely to occur in adults. Whereas the HQ of 1,3-butadiene in other areas is lower than 1, the risk is acceptable. Likewise, the HQ of benzene, chloroform, and 1,2-dichloroethane in all areas is less than 1. The carcinogenic risk assessment of 1,3-butadiene and benzene was 10-6 to 10-4 for both adults and children in Rayong (RY), Khon Kaen (KK), and Bangkok (BKK). Considering the other remaining chemicals, the carcinogenic risks were lower than 10-6 in all areas, which means the cancer risk is negligible.\nConclusion: The findings from this study revealed that 1,3-butadiene in ambient air was associated with high non-cancer risk and possible adverse health effects likely to affect human life in Rayong Province.\nKeywords: VOCs, Health Impact in Thailand, Hazard quotient, non-cancer risk",

Thus, it has been reliably established that in hepatopathies of various origins, the concentration of CGRP in the blood plasma increases significantly, which determines the hyperkinetics of the portal circulation characteristic of liver lesions.To assess the prospects of potentiation of hepatobiliary protector drugs using CGPR receptor antagonists, we used a drug with hepatoprotective activity \"Hepaton\" (developed by FGBOU VO \"SPbGUVM\", therapeutic dosage for rats - 0.5 mg / kg, duration of pharmacological correction - 7 days) in combination with monoclonal antibodies of class G2 (IgG2), binding with high affinity to the receptor of calcitonin-gene-related peptide (erenumab, Irinex, dosage for rats - 0.75 ml / kg, was used once before the start of the experiment) and their effect on the regeneration of hepatic pathology induced by the use of 1,2-dichloroethane (within 7 days) in standard dosages.Based on both experimental and scientific literature data, it can be concluded that drugs antagonists of CGPR receptors have an extremely wide range of applications in the future, including for potentiating other drugs used for pharmacological correction of various pathologies.Rational influence on CGPR receptors can reliably influence the maintenance of homeostasis and nociception of the hepatobiliary system.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "It is widely recognized that fine surface structures found in nature contribute to surface functionality, and studies on the design of functional materials based on biomimetics have been actively conducted. In this study, polymer thin films with hierarchically ordered surface structure were prepared by combining both nanoimprinting using anodically oxidized porous alumina (AAO) as a template and surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). To prepare such polymer films, we designed a new copolymer (poly{[2-(4-methyl-2-oxo-2H-chromen-7-yloxy)ethyl methacrylate]-co-[2-(2-bromo-2-methylpropionyloxy)ethyl methacrylate]}; poly(MCMA-co-HEMABr)) with coumarin moieties and α-haloester moieties in the pendants. The MCMA repeating units function to fix the pillar structure by photodimerization, and the HEMABr ones act as the polymerization initiation sites for SI-ATRP on the pillar surfaces. Surface structures consisting of vertically oriented multiple pillars were fabricated on the spin-coated poly(MCMA-co-HEMABr) thin films by nanoimprinting using an AAO template. Then, the coumarin moieties inside each pillar were crosslinked by UV light irradiation to fix the pillar structure. SEM observation confirmed that the internally crosslinked pillar structures were maintained even when immersed in organic solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane and anisole, which are employed as solvents under SI-ATRP conditions. Finally, poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains were grafted onto the thin film by SI-ATRP, respectively, to prepare the hierarchically ordered surface structure. Furthermore, in this study, the surface properties as well as the thermoresponsive hydrophilic/hydrophobic switching of the obtained polymer films were investigated. The surface morphology and chemistry of the films with and without pillar structures were compared, especially the interfacial properties expressed as wettability. Grafting poly(TFEMA) increased the static contact angle for both flat and pillar films, and the con-tact angle of the pillar film surface increased from 104° for the flat film sample to 112°, suggesting the contribution of the pillar structure. Meanwhile, the pillar film surface grafted with poly(NIPAM) brought about a significant change in wettability when changing the temperature between 22 °C and 38 °C.",

However, some frequently detected contaminants such as dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) have shown nearly no reactivity with nZVI. Here, we tested the feasibility of combining anaerobic dechlorinating bacteria, Dehalobacterium and Dehalogenimonas , and nZVI as a treatment train to detoxify chlorinated methanes (i.e., chloroform-CF- and DCM), and 1,2-DCA. First, we showed that CF (500 μM) was fully degraded by 1 g/L nZVI to DCM as a major by-product, which was susceptible to fermentation by Dehalobacterium to innocuous products. Our results indicate that soluble compounds released by nZVI might cause an inhibitory impact on Dehalobacterium activity, avoiding DCM depletion. The DCM dechlorination activity was recovered when transferred to a fresh medium without nZVI. The increase in H_2 production and pH was discarded as potential inhibitors. Similarly, a Dehalogenimonas -containing culture was unable to dichloroeliminate 1,2-DCA when exposed to 1 g/L nZVI, but dechlorinating activity was also recovered when transferred to nZVI-free media. The recovery of the dechlorinating activity of Dehalobacterium and Dehalogenimonas suggests that combination of nZVI and bioremediation techniques can be feasible under field conditions where dilution processes can alleviate the impact of the potential inhibitory soluble compounds.",

The ΔG^0′_tr,MIX→W values of all the ions tested were higher than those from DFP to W. Namely, the ions would exist more stably in MIX than DFP, even for fluorophilic ions. This is due to the addition of DCE, which has a higher dielectric constant. A comparison of ΔG^0′_tr,MIX→W with that from DCE to W showed a superior affinity of fluorophilic ions to the fluorous solvent in spite of equivolume addition of DCE.

The degradation of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) was only 40.0% in Fenton system, while in the presence of amorphous boron, it could reach to 93.0% in 60 min. HO• was demonstrated to be the major reactive oxygen species (ROSs) and responsible for DCA degradation. Further, the mechanism of amorphous boron-enhanced Fenton system was described as follows. With the addition of amorphous boron, the reduction process occurred on its surface and Fe(III) was regenerated to Fe(II) to further utilize H2O2 and produce more HO• for DCA removal. Meanwhile, amorphous boron was oxidized to B2O3 and a portion of H3BO3 leaching into the solution occurred. Both B2O3 and H3BO3 had no reactivity for Fe(III) reduction. Moreover, DCA could be entirely dechlorinated and mineralized to CO2, Cl− and H2O. Vinyl chloride (VC) and dichloromethane (DCM) were the mainly intermediates in DCA degradation and two possible pathways were inferred. Eventually, the performance of DCA degradation in complex solution matrixes and for other contaminants removal were tested, demonstrating the broad-spectrum reactivity and superiority of amorphous boron-enhanced Fenton system in the remediation of contaminated groundwater.",

The copolymerization of pentafluorophenol (PFP) active esters of 4-pentenoic acid and perillic acid with N-phenyl maleimide (PhMI) was studied in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-phenyl-2-propanol (HFPP). In DCE and for the copolymerization of the PFP ester of 4-pentenoic acid and PhMI in HFPP, polymers were formed where the active esters were separated by at least one PhMI unit. The average number of separating PhMI units can be controlled by varying the feed ratio of the monomers. For the copolymerization of the PFP ester of perillic acid in HFPP, a preference for the formation of periodic copolymers was observed, where active esters were preferably separated from each other by a maximum of two PhMI moieties. Therefore, the copolymerization of said active ester containing monomers with PhMI provides a platform to create polymers in which reactive moieties are distributed along the polymer chain in different fashions.

Pristine MWCNTs, A-MWCNTs, and P-MWCNTs were dispersed in 1,2-dichloroethane, then dropped onto a printed circuit board consisting of Cu/Au electrodes used as the sensor platform. Next, EC was separately spin coated on the pristine MWCNTs, A-MWCNTs, and P-MWCNTs (EC/MWCNTs, EC/A-MWCNTs, and EC/P-MWCNTs, resp.). All sensors responded to benzene vapor at room temperature by increasing their electrical resistance which was sensitive to benzene vapor. The EC/P90-MWCNTs enabled an approximately 11-fold improvement in benzene detection compared to EC/MWCNTs. The sensitivity of all sensors would be attributed to the swelling of EC, resulting in the loosening of the MWCNT network after benzene vapor exposure. The differences of the sensing responses of the EC/MWCNTs, EC/A-MWCNTs, and EC/P-MWCNTs would be ascribed to the differences in crystallinity and functionalization of MWCNT sidewalls, suggesting that acid and oxygen plasma treatments of MWCNTs would be promising techniques for the improvement of benzene detection.",

These multicomponent reactions exhibit excellent regioselectivity for 1,3-diynes, paving a path to the cascade cyclization of 3-fluoropyridine or N-methylpyridin-3-amine with 1,3-diynes for the construction of brand-new tricyclic-fused pyrano- or hydropyridoquinolizinium salts.

    "abstract": "Electrochemical aptamer-based sensors provide a highly modular platform for real-time monitoring of small molecules. Their ability to selectively recognize target molecules in complex environments like biological fluids makes them an attractive technology for the analysis of micro- and nanoscale systems. The signal-to-noise of the measurement depends on the electroactive surface (i.e., how many aptamers one can place), which has previously precluded miniaturization of aptamer-based sensors to planar disk ultramicroelectrodes (r ∼ 5-10 μm). Here, we employ a concentration enrichment strategy based on the active dissolution of an aqueous, aptamer-containing microdroplet on an ultramicroelectrode submerged in an organic continuous phase (1,2-dichloroethane). We show consistent voltammetric signal increase as a function of droplet lifetime, indicating the successful immobalization of the thiol-terminated aminoglycoside aptamers to the electrode surface. We observe a diagnostic methylene blue peak and 10-fold increase in current magnitude as compared to bare microelectrodes. We report robust sensor behavior with a linear dynamic range extending from milli- to micromolar concentrations of kanamycin in buffer. This research offers a successful method for optimized electrochemical aptamer-based sensor fabrication and miniaturization on ultramicroelectrodes without the need for electrode surface area enhancement.",

    "abstract": "The polarized interface between two immiscible liquids plays a central role in many technological processes. In particular, for electroanalytical and ion extraction applications, an external electric field is typically used to selectively induce the transfer of ionic species across the interfaces. Given that it is experimentally challenging to obtain an atomistic insight into the ion transfer process and the structure of liquid-liquid interfaces, atomistic simulations have often been used to fill this knowledge gap. However, due to the long-range nature of the electrostatic interactions and the use of 3D periodic boundary conditions, the use of external electric fields in molecular dynamics simulations requires special care. Here, we show how the simulation setup affects the dielectric response of the materials and demonstrate how by a careful design of the system it is possible to obtain the correct electric field on both sides of a liquid-liquid interface when using standard 3D Ewald summation methods. In order to prove the robustness of our approach, we ran extensive molecular dynamics simulations with a rigid-ion and polarizable force field of the water/1,2-dichloroethane interface in the presence of weak external electric fields.",

In the case of the MoS2 flakes with a BL, the vibrational modes of the Raman scattering did not shift.

Comparison of the values of the redox potentials of the synthesized ruthenium complexes in 1,2-dichloroethane with the values previously found for the corresponding ruthenacarboranes based on the parent dicarbollide anion showed that the introduction of methyl substituents into the carborane cage led to a decrease in the redox potentials of the complexes, which made them more preferable catalysts for ATRP.

Also, treatment of hydrazide 1 with diethyloxalate, chloroacetyl chloride, chloroacetic acid and/or 1,2-dichloroethane yielded the corresponding pyridotriazine derivatives 7–10. Further transformation of compound 1 with a different active methylene group, namely acetyl acetone, diethylmalonate, ethyl cyanoacetate, ethyl benzoylacetate and/or ethyl acetoacetate, produced the pyridine–pyrazole hybrid derivatives 11–15. These newly synthesized compounds (1–15) were subjected to in silico molecular docking screenings towards GlcN-6-P synthase as the target protein. The results revealed moderate to good binding energies of the ligands on the target protein. All the newly prepared products exhibited antimicrobial and antioxidant activity.",

    "abstract": "1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) is a pervasive environmental pollutant, and overexposure to this hazardous material causes brain edema and demyelination in humans. We found that 1,2-DCE inhibits aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and is a primary pathogenic effector of 1,2-DCE-induced brain edema in animals. However, AQP4 down-regulation’s link with cortex demyelination after 1,2-DCE exposure remains unclear. Thus, we exposed wild-type (WT) CD-1 mice and AQP4 knockout (AQP4-KO) mice to 0, 100, 350 and 700 mg/m3 1,2-DCE by inhalation for 28 days. We applied label-free proteomics and a cell co-culture system to elucidate the role of AQP4 inhibition in 1,2-DCE-induced demyelination. The results showed that 1,2-DCE down-regulated AQP4 in the WT mouse cortexes. Both 1,2-DCE exposure and AQP4 deletion induced neurotoxicity in mice, including increased brain water content, abnormal pathological vacuolations, and neurobehavioral damage. Tests for interaction of multiple regression analysis highlighted different effects of 1,2-DCE exposure level depending on the genotype, indicating the core role of AQP4 in regulation on 1,2-DCE-caused neurotoxicity. We used label-free quantitative proteomics to detect differentially expressed proteins associated with 1,2-DCE exposure and AQP4 inhibition, and identified down-regulation in myelin basic protein (MBP) and tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn (FYN) in a dose-dependent manner in WT mice but not in AQP4-KO mice. 1,2-DCE and AQP4 deletion separately resulted in demyelination, as detected by Luxol fast blue staining, and manifested as disordered nerve fibers and cavitation in the cortexes. Western blot and immunofluorescence confirmed the decreased AQP4 in the astrocytes and the down-regulated MBP in the oligodendrocytes by 1,2-DCE exposure and AQP4 inhibition, respectively. Finally, the co-culture results of SVG p12 and MO3.13 cells showed that 1,2-DCE-induced AQP4 down-regulation in the astrocytes was responsible for demyelination, by decreasing MBP in the oligodendrocytes. In conclusion, 1,2-DCE induced cortex demyelination by depressing MBP via AQP4 inhibition in the mice.",

    "title": "Optimization of DLLME Extraction Parameters for Pesticides Analysis by High Performance Liquid Chromatography",
    "doi": "10.11159/iceptp22.193",
    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "- Pesticides have been used widely all over the world for centuries to increase agricultural production and to combat harmful pests. Pesticides used for agriculture, household, and public health sectors eventually reach water bodies, posing a risk to human health and the environment even in micro concentrations. Each country legally sets its own maximum allowable limits to regulate pesticides residues. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor pesticide residues in water resources, especially if they are used for drinking water purposes. With the technological developments, nowadays sensitive analytical instruments employing complex analysis methods such as GC/MS and LC/MS have been used to analyze pesticides. Pesticide residues must be concentrated by different extraction methods before HPLC analysis to be able to detect them in micro levels with high precision and low detection limits. The aim of this study is to develop an analytical method for the analysis of acetochlor and metolachlor pesticides by HPLC instrument with dispersive liquid-liquid micro extraction (DLLME) method. In order to determine optimum conditions for DLLME extraction method, extraction solvent type (chloroform, dichloromethane and 1,2 dichloroethane), dispersive solvent type (acetonitrile, methanol and isopropyl alcohol), flowrate (1, 1.2 and 1.5 ml/min), oven temperature (20°C, 30 °C, 40 °C and 50 °C), volume of extraction solvent (300, 350 and 400 µl), and mobile phase mixture (60/40, 70/30 and 80/20 acetonitrile/water in v/v) were comprehensively investigated with Taguchi experimental design. The optimized conditions for acetochlor and metolachlor were obtained as: extraction solvent of 1,2-dichloroethane, dispersive solvent of acetonitrile and methanol, extraction solvent volume of 400 µL and 300 µL, dispersive volume of 1 ml, flowrate of 1 ml/min and 1.2 ml/min, temperature of 40°C and 50°C and mobile phase mixture of 70/30 v/v and 80/20 v/v, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Donor-donor'-acceptor triads (1, 2), based on [3.3]paracyclophane ([3.3]PCP) as a bridge, with electron-donating properties (D') using 1,4-dithiafulvene (DTF; TTF half unit) as a donor and dicyanomethylene (DCM; TCNE half unit) or an ethoxycarbonyl-cyanomethylene (ECM) as an acceptor were designed and synthesized. The pulse radiolysis study of 1 a in 1,2-dichloroethane allowed the clear assignment of the absorption bands of the DTF radical cation (1 a.+ ), whereas the absorption bands due to the DCM radical anion could not be observed by γ-ray radiolysis in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran rigid glass at 77 K. Electrochemical oxidation of 1 a first generates the DTF radical cation (1 a.+ ), the absorption bands of which are in agreement with those observed by a pulse radiolysis study, followed by dication (1 a2+ ). The ESR spectrum of 1 a.+ showed a symmetrical signal with fine structure and an ESR simulation predicted that the spin of 1 a.+ is delocalized over S and C atoms of the DTF moiety and the central C atom of the trimethylene bridge bearing the DTF moiety. Pulse radiolysis, ESR, and electrochemical studies indicate that the DTF radical cation of 1 a.+ is more stable than that of 6.+ , and the latter shows a strong tendency to dimerize. This result indicates that the [3.3]PCP moiety as a bridge can stabilize the DTF radical cation more than the 1,3-diphenylpropane moiety because of kinetic stability due to its rigid structure and the weak electronic interaction of DTF and DCM moieties through [3.3]PCP.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional ordered meso-macroporous La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.5Co0.5O3 (3DOM LSFCO)-supported Co3O4 catalysts were designed and prepared via a PMMA-templating strategy for the total oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). The physicochemical properties of all synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, HAADF-STEM, low-temperature N2 sorption, XPS, H2-TPR, and in situ FT-IR. The introduction of Co3O4 increases the generation rate of oxygen vacancy, playing a crucial role in adsorption and activation of oxygen species. The special 3DOM structure of perovskite-type oxide promotes 1,2-DCE molecules to effectively and intimately contact with the surface adsorbed oxygen over supported catalysts and further accelerates the redox process. Compared with pure LSFCO, all the Co3O4 supported catalysts show superior catalytic performance with reaction rate increases from 5.53 × 10−12 to 2.29 × 10−11 mol g−1 s−1 and E\n                     a decreases from 74.7 to 22.6 KJ mol−1. Amongst, the 10Co3O4/3DOM LSFCO catalyst exhibits the best catalytic activity, highest resistance to chlorine poisoning and lowest by-products concentration because of the largest amount of surface adsorbed oxygen. CO2, CO, HCl, and Cl2 are the main oxidation productions, while some typical reaction intermediates such as vinyl chloride, 1,1,2-trichloroethane and trichloroethylene are also observed, especially over the 3DOM LSFCO sample. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism of 1,2-DCE oxidation over obtained catalysts was proposed based on the results of gas chromatography, in situ FT-IR, and on-line MS. It is believed that the Co3O4/3DOM LSFCO are promising catalysts for the total removal of chlorinated volatile organic compounds.",

    "abstract": "The probability of formation of spin-correlated secondary radical ion pairs (RIPs) in diluted solutions of charge acceptors in irradiated haloalkanes is believed to be extremely low due to the dissociative attachment of excess electrons to solvent molecules. Contrary to this, it has been found that spin-correlated RIPs can be formed upon irradiation in some liquid chloroalkanes with yield sufficient to observe the recombination fluorescence of the RIP's partners. This allowed the study of primary radical cations (RCs) as well as radical ionic states of molecules dissolved in haloalkanes using the method of time-resolved magnetic field effect (TR MFE) in radiation-induced fluorescence. With this method, the magnetic resonance characteristics of the solvent RCs in a series of liquid haloalkanes were examined for the first time. For the 1,2-dichloroethane RC, the rate of scavenging by solute molecules and the dominant mechanisms of paramagnetic relaxation were determined. Polysulfone and poly(ethyl methacrylate) were used to demonstrate that due to their high dissolving ability, chloroalkanes can be exploited as solvents to study the magnetic resonance characteristics of radical ionic states of polymeric molecules in solutions with the TR MFE method.",

For light-emitting applications, however, doping must increase carrier injection without quenching excitonic emission. While chemical treatment with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) has been demonstrated as an effective post-growth n-doping method for 2D TMDs, its effects on optical properties, specifically the retention of optical characteristics and excitonic behaviour, remain unclear. Here, we investigate the layer- and time-dependent optical effects of DCE on molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our results show that DCE treatment rapidly reduces the indirect bandgap transition, while leaving the direct transition unaffected. DFT confirms that chlorine atoms bind to sulphur vacancies, creating in-gap states that facilitate non-radiative recombination and suppress the indirect PL. This work demonstrates DCE can selectively engineer the optical band structure in MoS₂, paving the way for more efficient 2D optoelectronic devices.",

Redox and acid properties and reaction intermediates of the samples were measured by means of various techniques. The RuO2 species were dominantly present in the supported bimetallic samples, and Co doping could increase the length of the Ru−O bond. Compared with RuCo/meso-MgO and RuCo/meso-Al2O3, RuCo/HZSM-5 exhibited the highest catalytic activity (T\n                     90% =281 °C, TOFNoble metal = 3.6 × 10−3 s−1, reaction rate at 270 °C = 18.7 μmol/(gNoble metal s), and apparent activation energy =36 kJ/mol at SV = 20,000 mL/(g h)) and the best Cl-resistant performance, which was associated with its strong redox ability, suitable acidity, good 1,2-DCE adsorption capacity, highly dispersed RuCo NPs, and strong interaction between RuCo NPs and HZSM-5. Loading of RuCo NPs on the support could suppress the formation of C2H3Cl and improve the Cl-resistant performance. Over the RuCo/HZSM-5 sample, the partial deactivation induced by water vapor or HCl addition was reversible, while that induced by SO2 introduction was irreversible. Based on the characterization results, we believe that the oxidation of 1,2-DCE over RuCo/meso-Al2O3, RuCo/meso-MgO or RuCo/HZSM-5 might take place concurrently via the Langmuir−Hinshelwood and Mars−van Krevelen mechanisms.

We aimed to evaluate DNA damage due to possible carcinogen exposure (phenylhydrazine, ethylene oxide, dichloromethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane) in lymphocytes of pharmaceutical industry workers from the same production line. Population comprised 16 subjects (9 females and 7 males) who were exposed to multiple chemicals for 8 months. Genome damage was assessed using alkaline comet assay, micronucleus assay, and comet assay coupled with fluorescent in situ hybridization (comet-FISH). After 8 months of exposure, the issue of irregular use of all available personal protective equipment (PPE) came into light. To decrease the risk of exposure, strict use of PPE was enforced. After 8 months of strict PPE use, micronuclei frequency and comet assay parameters in lymphocytes of pharmaceutical workers significantly decreased compared with prior period of irregular PPE use. Comet-FISH results indicated a significant shift in distribution of signals for the TP 53 gene toward a more frequent occurrence in the comet tail. Prolonged exposure to possible carcinogens may hinder DNA repair mechanisms and affect structural integrity of TP 53. Two indicators of loss of TP 53 gene integrity have risen, namely, TP 53 fragmentation rate in lymphocytes with persistently elevated primary damage and incidence of TP 53 deletions in undamaged lymphocytes.",

This study evaluated VOC characteristics and distribution to assess associated health risks for workers and communities at varying distances from automotive painting facilities in Thailand, focusing on stacks and wastewater treatment plants that handle solvent-containing wastewater. The findings revealed aromatic compounds were predominant (66% of the total emissions), followed by oxygenated VOCs (26%). The stacks mainly emitted aromatics such as toluene and ethylbenzene, whereas the wastewater released oxygenated VOCs, particularly methyl isobutyl ketone and methyl ethyl ketone. The exposure concentrations in each area were primarily influenced by wind direction, with higher levels observed by downwind. The hazard index for areas was less than 1, indicating safe noncarcinogenic risk levels. The lifetime cancer risk showed that ethylbenzene posed a probable risk in all areas (maximum 8.15 × 10⁻⁶ μg/m³), whereas 1,2-dichloroethane exhibited a probable risk within 200 meters of the facility (maximum 4.13 × 10⁻⁵ μg/m³).

    "abstract": "Electrification of water in clouds leads to fascinating redox reactions on Earth. However, little is known about cloud electrochemistry, except for lightning, a natural hazard that is nearly impossible to harness. We report a controllable electrochemistry that can be enabled in microclouds by fast phase switching of water between the microdroplet, vapor, and bulk phase. Due to the size-dependent charge transfer between droplets during atomization, this process generates an alternating voltage arising from the self-electrification and discharging of microdroplets, vapor, and bulk phase by electron and ion transfer. We show that the microclouds with alternating voltage cause 1,2-dichloroethane (ClH2C–CH2Cl) to be converted to vinyl chloride (H2C=CHCl) at ∼80% selectivity. These findings highlight the importance of controlled cloud electrochemistry in accelerating the removal of volatile organic compounds and treating contaminated water.

The combination of DLLME and GFAAS methods is favourable for GFAAS is a well-established technique with excellent sensitivity, and is suitable for low volume of sample of the remained phase obtained after DLLME. For DLLME, a newly synthesised reagent 5-(5-Cyano-2-pyridylazo)-2,4-diaminotoluene (5-CN-PADAT) was used as a chelating agent, 1,2-dichloroethane (CH2ClCH2Cl) and acetonitrile (CH3CN) as extraction and dispersive solvent. Several variables potentially affecting the extraction efficiency and its subsequent determination, such as type and volume of extraction and disperser solvents, pH of test solution, extraction time, volume and concentration of the chelating agent and salt effect, were investigated and optimised. After phase separation, 10 µL of the sedimented phase containing enriched analytes was injected into GFAAS for the determination of cobalt. Under the optimised conditions, the analytical graph was linear in the range of 0.04 ~ 1.0 ng mL−1, and the limit of detection was 0.01 ng L−1 for cobalt. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for 10 replicate measurements of 0.2 ng L−1 of cobalt was 3.6%. Enrichment factor (EF) calculated as the ratio of the slopes of the calibration graphs obtained with and without DLLME was 96 for 5.0 mL sample solution.

We provide a coarse-grained approach for the practical definition of the instantaneous interface and present numerical results for the prototypical water/1,2-dichloroethane system. These results show that the parallel components of the dielectric permittivity tensor can be accurately extracted.

A discrete dodecavanadate bowl, [V12 O32 ]4- (V12), with an entrance diameter of 4.4 Å and an electron-rich guest at the center of the bowl, was stabilized by electrostatic interactions. A characteristic of V12 is a solid-state polytopal rearrangement during guest elimination and recapture.

Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that one of the VO5 square pyramids at the bottom of V12-free was inverted to fill the void of the bowl cavity. The exposure of V12-free to the guest molecule vapors of CH2 Cl2 , 1,2-dichloroethane, MeNO2 , MeCN, and MeBr resulted in the selective insertion of the guest to reform the guest-inserted V12 structure.

    "abstract": "\n\nThe oxidation of aromatic primary alcohols is pivotal in organic synthesis,\nconverting accessible starting materials into valuable intermediates. Traditional methods often rely\non chromium-based reagents, which are hazardous and environmentally problematic. Ionic liquids,\nparticularly those based on imidazolium cations, offer an attractive alternative due to their unique\nsolvent properties and chemical stability. However, their application in oxidation reactions has been\nlimited by challenges such as selectivity and efficiency. Recent advancements have focused on\nintegrating chromium complexes into imidazolium ionic liquids to harness their catalytic potential.\nUnderstanding the catalytic efficiency and mechanistic insights of chromium-functionalized imidazolium\ndi-cationic ionic liquids in alcohol oxidation is crucial for developing sustainable and efficient\nsynthetic methodologies aiming to mitigate environmental impact and improve synthetic efficiency\nin organic chemistry.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this study was to synthesize, characterize, and explore the catalytic efficiency\nand mechanism of chromium-functionalized imidazolium di-cationic ionic liquids in the oxidation\nof aromatic primary alcohols.\n\n\n\nThe oxidation of benzyl alcohol was optimized by varying solvent and temperature parameters.\nInitially, benzyl alcohol was subjected to oxidation in different solvents: water, DMF,\nACN, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, and DMSO at room temperature. Solvent effects were evaluated,\nwith DMF, ACN, and DMSO yielding approximately 80% conversion to the desired aldehyde.\nInterestingly, DCE did not yield the desired aldehyde. CHCl3 emerged as the optimal solvent,\nachieving a high yield of 94% in minimal reaction time. Temperature optimization revealed that at\nroom temperature, the reaction required 40 minutes to reach 94% yield. Increasing the temperature\nto 60 °C reduced the reaction time to 10 minutes while maintaining a high yield of 98%. Thus, 60\n°C was identified as the optimal temperature for maximizing both yield and reaction speed. The\nmethodological adjustments of solvent and temperature parameters provided crucial insights for\noptimizing the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using chromium-functionalized imidazolium di-cationic\nionic liquid.\n\n\n\nReactions at room temperature required longer times and yielded lower product amounts\ncompared to reactions conducted at higher temperatures. Importantly, no over-oxidation to carboxylic\nacids was observed. Electron-donating groups on aromatic alcohol substrates led to higher\nyields of aldehydes in shorter times. Conversely, substrates with electron-withdrawing groups\nshowed reduced yields (84% to 92%) over extended periods. Primary aliphatic alcohols exhibited\nlower yields even with prolonged reaction times, while secondary alcohols yielded fewer oxidation\nproducts. Recycling [DIL]2+[Cr2O7]2- for four cycles showed decreased yields over successive\nuses, highlighting its potential for continuous catalytic use in alcohol oxidation.\n\n\n\nIn this study, imidazolium-based Di-cationic ionic liquid [DIL]2+[Cr2O7]2- was synthesized,\nand its ionic liquid properties were demonstrated using TGA and DSC. Our developed\ncatalyst efficiently converts primary aromatic alcohols to aldehydes using [DIL]2+[Cr2O7]2- or\n[DIL]2+[Cr2O7]2-/H5IO6, offering solvent-free rapid oxidation, catalyst recyclability for up to\nfour cycles, and facile catalyst recovery. In comparison to other available oxidants, the developed\nprotocol has a superior yield, ease of workup, ease of handling, and low hygroscopicity.\n",

Preparing the sample at two concentrations, we find that τp-p reduction, from 1.0 s to 0.1 s, increases its transmittance when input pulse energy ε1 exceeds a threshold εT, which is lower for the dilute solution than the concentrated one. At two ε1's above εT for the dilute solution, τp-p-reduction-induced transmittance increase in the dilute solution, as compared to that in the concentrated solution, is more at the lower ε1 and less at the higher ε1. This differs from continuous-wave-driven thermal diffusion which always causes a larger transmittance increase in the concentrated solution by inducing a larger temperature gradient. From this study, we predict that solute migration induced by short pulses at 1064 nm is one of the undesired heating effects occurring when this solution is used to simultaneously Q-switch and mode-lock Nd:YAG lasers.",

In this study, Ru- and Nb-co-modified CeO2 catalysts were designed to achieve excellent activity, stability, and CO2 selectivity in the catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC). The formation of Nb-O-Ce bonds was observed to enhance the surface acidic sites, thereby improving HCl selectivity and reducing the production of chlorinated byproducts. Meanwhile, it inhibits the formation of Ru-O-Ce and promotes the generation of highly dispersed RuO2 particles on the surface, enhancing the redox properties and mobility of the surface oxygen, thus increasing CO2 selectivity. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results revealed that chlorine species preferentially attach to Nb species rather than to oxygen vacancies on the Ru/Nb/CeO2 catalyst. This allows more alkane groups to oxidize to formate on the oxygen vacancies, reducing byproduct concentration. Additionally, the oxidation of alkane groups to carboxylic acids is initiated on the Nb species, completing a comprehensive oxidation process under the synergistic effect of RuO2.",

However, there was no significant change in the protein content of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). The expressions of adenylate cyclase (AC) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) contents were also reduced.

Here authors demonstrate a mechanism of spontaneous droplet formation, where the interfacial solute flux promotes droplet formation at the liquid-liquid interface when a phase transfer agent is present. Emulsions are critical across a broad spectrum of industries. Unfortunately, emulsification requires a significant driving force for droplet dispersion. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism of spontaneous droplet formation (emulsification), where the interfacial solute flux promotes droplet formation at the liquid-liquid interface when a phase transfer agent is present. We have termed this phenomenon fluxification. For example, when HAuCl_4 is dissolved in an aqueous phase and [NBu_4][ClO_4] is dissolved in an oil phase, emulsion droplets (both water-in-oil and oil-in-water) can be observed at the interface for various oil phases (1,2-dichloroethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and nitrobenzene). Emulsification occurs when AuCl_4^– interacts with NBu_4^+, a well-known phase-transfer agent, and transfers into the oil phase while ClO_4^– transfers into the aqueous phase to maintain electroneutrality. The phase transfer of SCN^– and Fe(CN)_6^3– also produce droplets. We propose a microscopic mechanism of droplet formation and discuss design principles by tuning experimental parameters.",

To rationalise and understand solvate formation, solvate stability and desolvation reactions a careful control of the experimental crystallisation and storage conditions, a range of thermoanalytical methods and crystal structure prediction were required. Six of the eight DDS monosolvates are reported and characterised for the first time.

The computed structures were used as input for Rietveld refinements and isostructurality of four of the monosolvates was confirmed. Packing comparisons of the solvate structures and molecular properties of the solvent molecules indicated that both size/shape of the solvent molecule and the possible DDSsolvent interactions are the important factors for DDS solvate formation.

The microbial community detected in Column A at the end of the experimental period was mainly enriched in sulfate reducing bacteria that could act as both fermenting and dechlorinating agents.

Highly efficient catalysts with chlorine resistance need to be developed urgently. Herein, a series of Mn-Fe oxides catalysts with core–shell structures were synthesized and applied to the catalytic ozonation of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). By optimizing the catalyst morphology and elemental ratios, Mn0.3Fe0.7Ox achieved approximately 97% 1,2-DCE conversion and over 90% mineralization at ambient temperature. The thinner shell of Mn0.3Fe0.7Ox facilitated efficient electron cycling between the core and shell. The high specific surface area, abundant lattice defects, and weak acidity of the catalyst promoted its excellent performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Mn-rich shell weakened the strong adsorption of 1,2-DCE and its intermediates on the catalyst, a key mechanism for improving chlorine resistance. The possible mechanisms of catalytic ozonation of 1,2-DCE involve activation of O3, oxidation of 1,2-DCE, and electron cycling processes. 1,2-DCE is finally degraded into HCl, H2O, and CO2.

Then, from the same samples, three different naturally occurring bacteria were isolated and cultured under optimized conditions then stimulated for a good result.

    "abstract": "Background Previous studies found elevated concentrations of fumigants and other chemicals in the air of unopened shipping containers, which led to the assumption that workers were likely to be highly exposed. This study assessed personal 8 hour exposures in workers handling cargo from shipping containers or export logs, which were fumigated prior to loading. Methods 193 personal 8 hour air samples were collected and analysed for 1,2-dibromoethane, chloropicrin, ethylene oxide, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen phosphide and methyl bromide, 1,2-dichloroethane, C2-alkylbenzenes, acetaldehyde, ammonia, benzene, formaldehyde, methanol, styrene and toluene. Additive Mixture Values were calculated using the Work Exposure (WES) standard set by Worksafe NZ and the Threshold Limit Values (TLV) set by the ACGIH. Linear regression was conducted to assess associations between time spent inside shipping containers and exposure (n=98). Results Chemical exposures as indicated by median and geometric mean values were low (e.g. 2.5 and 4.4 ppb respectively for methyl bromide) and none exceeded the NZ WES, although formaldehyde exceeded the TLV in 48 (26.2%) samples. The AMV-TLV threshold of 1 was exceeded in 54 (29.5%) samples. Major differences between the occupational groups (container, log and retail workers and fumigators) were not found. Time spent inside the container was significantly and positively associated with ethylene oxide, C2-alkylbenzenes and acetaldehyde, but this was based on a small number of detectable observations (non-detects 52.0%–95.9%) and for one chemical (methyl bromide, n=94) we found inverse associations. Conclusion This study has shown that personal exposures measured over an 8 hour working day were low, with the exception of formaldehyde, and do not confirm earlier suggestions (based on measurements inside closed containers) that they regularly exceed exposure limits. Association with time spent unloading containers was weak suggesting that exposures may result from short peak exposures rather than continuous low level exposure.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying ion association and collective dynamical processes in organic electrolytes is essential for fundamental property interpretation and optimization for electrochemical applications. The extent of ion correlation depends on both the ion concentration and dielectric strength of the solvent; ions may be largely uncorrelated in sufficiently high-dielectric solvents at low concentration, but properties of concentrated electrolytes are dictated by correlated and collective ion processes. In this work, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to characterize ion association and collective ion dynamics in organic electrolytes composed of binary mixtures of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [BMIM+][BF4-] and 1,2-dichloroethane, acetone, acetonitrile, and water solvents. We illustrate different physical regimes of characteristically distinct ion correlations for the systematic range of electrolyte concentrations and solvent dielectric strengths. Dilute electrolytes composed of low-dielectric solvents exhibit significant counterion correlation in the form of ion pairing and clustering driven by both weak screening and relatively low solvation energies. This regime is characterized by enhanced ion coordination numbers and near equality of cation and anion diffusion coefficients, despite the significantly different ion sizes. In contrast, ion correlation in highly concentrated electrolytes is dominated by the anti-correlated motion of both like-charge and opposite-charge ions, approaching neat ionic liquid behavior. We show that the cross-over of these correlation regimes is clearly illuminated by quantifying the fractional self and distinct contributions to the net ionic conductivity. For organic electrolytes composed of low-dielectric solvents, we conclude that significant ion correlation exists at all concentrations but the nature of the correlation changes markedly from the dilute electrolyte to the pure ionic liquid limit.",

    "abstract": "1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) is a widely used industrial solvent known to exert neurotoxic effects upon exposure. Hsp90 inhibition has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate neuroinflammation by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, its role in mitigating 1,2-DCE-induced neurotoxicity remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the neuroprotective effect of the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG against 1,2-DCE-induced neurotoxicity and to elucidate the underlying mechanism involving NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Forty male CD-1 mice were exposed to 1,2-DCE (0, 100, 350, 700 mg/m3)via inhalation for 28 days, followed by treatment with 17-AAG. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and Y-maze tests. Inflammatory cytokines and NLRP3 inflammasome proteins were measured in whole brain homogenates, while hippocampal tissue was analyzed for region-specific neuroinflammation and apoptosis. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells were transfected with si-NLRP3 or control siRNA and treated with 1,2-DCE and/or 17-AAG. The 28-day repeated inhalation exposure to 1,2-DCE significantly impaired cognitive functions in mice, induced cerebral inflammation and apoptosis, and upregulated NLRP3 inflammasome components. Treatment with 17-AAG alleviated these effects by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, NLRP3 knockdown abolished the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of 17-AAG in BV2 cells, confirming the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating these protective effects. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Hsp90 inhibition by 17-AAG effectively attenuates 1,2-DCE-induced neurotoxicity via suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target against environmental neurotoxicants.",

    "abstract": "Water is an indispensable strategic resource for biological and social development. The problem of oily wastewater pollution originating from oil spillages, industrial discharge and domestic oil pollution has become an extremely serious international challenge. At present, numerous superwetting materials have been applied to effectively separate oil and water. However, most of these materials are difficult to scale and their large–scale application is limited by cost and environmental protection. Herein, a simple, environmentally friendly strategy including sol–gel, freeze–drying and surface hydrophobic modification is presented to fabricate a bamboo cellulose foam with special wetting characteristics. The bamboo cellulose foam is superhydrophobic, with a water contact angle of 160°, and it has the superoleophilic property of instantaneous oil absorption. Owing to the synergistic effect of the three–dimensional network structure of the superhydrophobic bamboo cellulose foam and its hydrophobic composition, it has an excellent oil–absorption performance of 11.5 g/g~37.5 g/g for various types of oil, as well as good recyclability, with an oil (1,2–dichloroethane) absorption capacity of up to 31.5 g/g after 10 cycles. In addition, the prepared cellulose–based foam exhibits an outstanding performance in terms of acid and alkali corrosion resistance. Importantly, owing to bamboo cellulose being a biodegradable, low–cost, natural polymer material that can be easily modified, superhydrophobic/superoleophilic bamboo cellulose foam has great application potential in the field of oily wastewater treatment.",

    "abstract": "Due to the current use of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in many fields and their potential dissolution/transformation into ionic gold (Au3+), there is an increasing interest in methods enabling the discrimination of Au3+ from AuNPs in environmental samples. In this contribution, the combination of a novel ligandless surfactant-assisted emulsification microextraction procedure (LL-SAEME) with total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) is proposed for the isolation and preconcentration of Au3+ in aqueous extracts containing AuNPs. The method is fast, simple, and involves low operating costs and low consumption of reagents in comparison with other spectroscopic methods. It is based on the formation of a gold hydrophobic compound with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) which is extracted in a few microliters of 1,2-dichloroethane. After shaking the solution by hand for 5 s, the mixture is centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 rpm and 5 μL of the organic phase containing the gold ions are deposited on a quartz reflector to carry out the TXRF analysis. Using this approach, the limit of detection for gold was 0.05 μg/L and a good linearity ( R2 > 0.99) was assessed in the range of 1-500 μg/L. Moreover, no matrix effects were observed when ionic gold was extracted from different types of water such as river, mineral, and tap waters as well as in synthetic aqueous solutions containing other ions, AuNPs, and dissolved organic matter. As a study case, the developed LL-SAEME-TXRF method was applied to monitor AuNPs stability in soils in laboratory-controlled experiments by means of Au3+ monitoring over time.",

In this research, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes, namely prism[2]dihydrophenazine (anti-P2P20, syn-P2P20, and P2P22), composed of two dihydrophenazine derivatives subunits bridged by methylene groups, were conveniently synthesized by AlCl3-catalyzed one-pot condensation in 1,2-dichloroethane. Both anti-P2P20 and its isomer syn-P2P20 exhibited flexible and convertible conformation with narrow cavity, while P2P22 possessed rigid and rhombic-like skeleton due to the more steric hindrance on subunits. In addition, the selection of electron-deficient guest was found to influence the outside binding behavior of syn-P2P20. Fantastic regular supramolecular tessellation was fabricated by tiling of syn-P2P20 with tetrafluoro-1,4-benzoquinone (TFB) through the exo-wall interactions. Using 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFN) as a linker, only the regular 2D network superstructure with periodic units in a plane was obtained through cocrystallization. This work not only reports the construction of supramolecular tessellations by using prism[2]dihydrophenazines as building blocks, but also provides a new perspective for the design of macrocyclic arenes and fabrication of 2D supramolecular materials.",

The high solubility of BTPPA+TFPB− in toluene at room temperature enabled the electrochemical measurements. The potential window at the W|toluene interface is about 1.09 V, which is 0.30 V larger than that at the W|1,2‐dichloroethane interface when using 10 mmol dm−3 NaCl as the supporting electrolyte in W. The transfer reactions of quaternary ammonium ions across the W|toluene interface were found to be reversible. Formal potentials for ion transfer from W to toluene were evaluated, and linear correlations were observed between these formal potentials and the standard potentials reported at the W|nitrobenzene, W|1,2‐dichloroethane, and W|2‐nitrophenyl octyl ether interfaces.",

The aim of this work was to find the relationship between biological markers and morphological changes in acute damage to rat kidneys with dichloroethane. The study of urine samples of experimental animals by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) revealed 1,2-dichloroethane in the concentration range of 0,05 – 0,90 µg / ml (95% C.I. = 0,09 – 0,90 µg / ml). Daily excretion with urine was 0,60 – 4,50 µg / 16h (95% C.I. = 1,14 – 3,93 µg / ml). Levels of nephron-specific biomarkers in urine were 194,62 ± 9,02 IU / L (NAGase, p = 0,0022) and 2,93 ± 0,38 ng / ml (KIM-1, p = 0,0022), which exceeded those in the control group by 5 and 23 times, respectively.

Objective: To study dynamics of the excretion of TDAA into urine of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production workers. Methods: The study sample consisted of 65 workers of VC and PVC divisions with various time intervals following exposure to the chemicals, 10 shift workers from PVC division, and 34 workers not exposed to the chemicals (control group). Analysis of urinary TDAA was carried out with gas chromatography with mass-selective detector. Results: The concentrations of TDAA in the urine of workers of the VC division and in group of primary occupations who had a high level of exposure to the chemicals, were significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of workers of the PVC production division and group of auxiliary professions. The highest levels of TDAA in the urine of workers were found at the beginning of the next shift and during a long break, 24–48 hours after the cessation of the exposure. Conclusion: When conducting biomonitoring studies in PVC production workers, the optimal time for collecting urine samples is at the beginning of the next shift or during a long rest, 24–48 hours after the exposure.",

This compound is difficult to remove from groundwater and has the potential to inflict significant harm on human health and the environment. This study used sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8) activated by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to remove 1,2-DCA from aqueous solutions. Density functional theory was employed to calculate the potential energy surface of the reactants, intermediates, transient states, and products to thoroughly analyze the degradation pathways. The computations were performed in combination with in situ remediation of a 1,2-DCA plume from a point source to verify the industrial applicability of the technology. The results showed the 1,2-DCA removal efficiency was impacted considerably by the Na2S2O8 dosage and the dosing sequence of Na2S2O8 and NaOH, with the mean removal ratio reaching 96.24%. A free radical reaction was the main pathway of 1,2-DCA degradation; superoxide radical (O2\n                     •–) existed stably and played a key role in the reaction, and the main transformation proceeded via a vinyl chloride intermediate. The maximum removal of 1,2-DCA reached 91.79% in the in situ remediation.

The devices were characterized by two-terminal optoelectronic measurements in dark and in the presence of broadband lights at room temperature. The devices were then endowed with more dominant electrons as the doping agent by soaking the samples in 1,2 dichloroethane, while predominant hole doping was made possible using UV ozone treatment. The doping effect in MoS2 by 1,2 dichloroethane is believed to be a result of the substitution of sulfur vacancies by the chlorine atoms. The doping effect by UV ozone is imparted as a result of a redox reaction occurring between the water adlayer on the surface of MoS2 and ozone atoms. We have elaborated on the effect of dopants and broadband lights on the two-terminal electrical performance of the devices. A considerable difference in electrical performance is observed between the two dopants in the presence of broadband lights. Due to the substitutional doping effects, significantly higher currents after doping via 1,2 dichloroethane were observed even at low voltages in the dark. The electrical response is attenuated in the presence of broadband lights after chloride doping.",

Kaohsiung is Taiwan’s second-largest city, known for its heavily industrialized and densely populated development. The Linhai industrial park, located in this region, contains roughly 500 industrial facilities that contributed to the emission of HAPs. The purpose of this study was to identify the volatile organic compound (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM)-bounded heavy metals and to examine the effects of the method detection limit (MDL) for analyzed species and the sampling program on health risk assessments. This study identified formaldehyde, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetaldehyde, benzene, and vinyl chloride. As, ethylbenzene, Ni, Cr(VI), Cd, Pb, and 1,3-butadiene were defined as high-risk species and VOCs accounted for more than 95% of respiratory-related health risks, this study proposes that the MDL for analysis methods and the sampling frequency for different species (and the species of interest) would eventually affect the results of health risk assessments. In other words, the current control strategies for reducing health risks may be ineffective. This research output can be used to comprehend the effects of MDL on the health risk assessments of HAPs better while also providing a reliable method to determine the major sources of air pollutants in urban industrial areas.",

Capacitance data obtained from the EIS measurement were shown to have higher values at lower applied electric voltages when charged lipids of DOPG is involved to form the monolayer, while the same trend was observed for monolayer made of just neutral DOPC but only at higher applied voltages. Since the capacitance values are inversely proportional to the interfacial width, these results indicated that the interfacial adsorption/desorption behaviors of phospholipid monolayers made of neutral lipids DOPC compared to that of with the presence of charged DOPG under the influence of electric potentials are distinctively different. Additionally, we have studied the behavior of lipid monolayers with and without charged DOPG after different equilibration times of 30 and 300 s.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nPrevious studies have reported high concentrations of airborne fumigants and other chemicals inside unopened shipping containers, but it is unclear whether this is reflective of worker exposures.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe collected personal 8-h air samples using a whole-air sampling method. Samples were analysed for 1,2-dibromoethane, chloropicrin, ethylene oxide, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen phosphide, methyl bromide, 1,2-dichloroethane, C2-alkylbenzenes, acetaldehyde, ammonia, benzene, formaldehyde, methanol, styrene, and toluene. Additive Mixture Values (AMVs) were calculated using the New Zealand Workplace Exposure standard (WES) and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) of the 8-h, time-weighted average exposure limit. Linear regression was conducted to assess associations with work characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 133 workers handling shipping containers, 15 retail workers unpacking container goods, 40 workers loading fumigated and non-fumigated export logs, and 5 fumigators. A total of 193 personal 8-h air measurements were collected. Exposures were generally low, with >50% below the limit of detection for most chemicals, and none exceeding the NZ WES, although formaldehyde exceeded the TLV in 26.2% of all measurements. The AMV-TLV threshold of 1 was exceeded in 29.0% of the measurements. Levels and detection frequencies of most chemicals varied little between occupational groups, although exposure to methyl bromide was highest in the fumigators (median 43 ppb) without exceeding the TLV of 1000 ppb. Duration spent inside the container was associated with significantly higher levels of ethylene oxide, C2-alkylbenzenes, and acetaldehyde, but levels were well below the TLV/WES. Exposure levels did not differ between workers handling fumigated and non-fumigated containers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal exposures of workers handling container cargo in New Zealand were mainly below current exposure standards, with formaldehyde the main contributor to overall exposure. However, as it is not clear whether working conditions of participants included in this study were representative of this industry as a whole, and not all relevant exposures were measured, we cannot exclude the possibility that high exposures may occur in some workers.",

Tese (Doutorado em Ciências) – Instituto de Física, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, 2017. With the increase of computational power in the last decades, the molecular modeling of problems in several areas has become more accessible, being today a fundamental tool used to understand several processes. In particular, molecular simulations with classical force fields have been important for the sampling of thermodynamic properties, for the determination of structures and population of conformers, and for the selection of configurations to be used with methods that combine quantum mechanics with molecular mechanics. The most common simulation methods used nowadays are molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC). Both methods are in principle equivalent when the goal is configurational sampling, with MD having the advantage of allowing the analysis of the dynamics and temporal evolution, while MC has the advantage of generating the configurations in a probabilistic manner, not necessarily following a path in the potential energy surface, possibly resulting in a more efficient sampling. However, there is no MC methodology that can be considered efficient and established to sample the internal degrees of freedom of molecules with arbitrary complexity. In order to advance in the development of methods that want to achieve this goal, in this work the method presented by Shah e Maginn[1] has been implemented and improved. In the method, the molecule is fragmented into smaller parts, each one composed by the hard degrees of freedom, which do not vary dramatically during the simulation. Those fragments are then connected by soft degrees of freedom, the dihedral and non-bonded terms of the energy. During the simulation the molecule has some of its fragments deleted, and is reconstructed using a Configurational Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) approach. The contribution of this work to the methodology is generalizing the fragment types within the method, the simplification of the acceptance criteria and some extensions with additional biases, such as electrostatic potential bias and the acceptance criterion of the preferential sampling with the CBMC. The implementation was evaluated through simulations in two simple systems: octane and 1,2-dichloroethane. Comparing the sampling and results obtained for the populations of conformers with MD results, experimental data or values obtained with different MC methods present in the literature, we verified that the implementation reproduces the expected results. Beyond that, the conformational equilibrium of the mesityl oxide (MOx) molecule which has two conformers: syn and anti, was investigated. Due to the potential energy barrier between the two conformers of about 10 kcal/mol, the MD does not perform an ergodic simulation, while the CBMC does the same sampling accordingly. In the CBMC simulation, the inversion of the dominant conformer in gas phase and water was observed. The MOx simulation in acetonitrile and methanol showed that the frequency of the anti conformer indeed increases with the solvent polarity. Nonetheless, due to the stretch of the C−O bond of MOx in methanol, attributed to the hydrogen bonds formed with the solvent, the conformational contribution to the maximum of the absorption band π−π∗ does not follow the polarity tendency, having a larger blue shift in acetonitrile than in methanol. The C−O bond stretch can only be seen because the Cartesian displacement sampling with the Metropolis method was introduced to the original CBMC method. This effect attributed to the stretch is compensated by the solvent, in a way that the total contribution to the transition energy follows the solvent polarity. In general, we conclude that the performance of the developed CBMC method is excellent to the studied cases, being even superior to MD in some cases. The implementation in DICE leaves an important legacy to several research groups, not only for introducing the CBMC method, but also due to general improvements such as parallelization, neighbor list and code modernization, which were introduced during the project.",

We analyzed container air with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (TD-2D-GC-MS/FPD) and assessed whether the concentration of the volatiles benzene and 1,2-dichloroethane exceeded recommended exposure limits (REL). Products were taken from transport containers and analyzed for outgassing of volatiles. Furthermore, experimental outgassing was performed on packaging materials and textiles, to simulate the hazards tainting from globally shipped goods. The mean amounts of benzene in analyzed container air were 698-fold higher, and those of ethylene dichloride were 4.5-fold higher than the corresponding REL. More than 90% of all containers struck with toluene residues higher than its REL. For 1,2-dichloroethane 53% of containers, transporting shoes exceeded the REL. In standardized experimental fumigation of various products, outgassing of 1,2-dichloroethane under controlled laboratory conditions took up to several months.

The ionic partition diagram of the ionizable drugs was determined through the voltammetric analysis of ion transfer responses. In the DIP system, the additional voltammetric responses associated with the interfacial adsorption were observed in the positive potential region. Although the spectroscopic features of the drug species in the aqueous solution were hardly affected by the addition of the dendrimers, the ion transfer currents in the DIP and PRO systems were decreased in the presence of the G3.5 PAMAM dendrimer indicating the intermolecular association between the cationic drugs and negatively charged dendrimers in the interfacial region. The interfacial mechanism of the fluorescent DIP species was investigated in detail by potential-modulated fluorescence (PMF) spectroscopy. The PMF results demonstrated that the monoprotonated form, HDIP+, was transferred across the water|DCE interface accompanied by the adsorption process. The interfacial mechanism of the DIP species was significantly modified by the dendrimer, depending on the pH condition. Under acidic conditions, the positively charged G3.5 PAMAM dendrimer adsorbed at the interface effectively prevented the coadsorption of HDIP+.

    "abstract": "LaOCl-mediated ethane chlorination into 1,2-dichloroethane offers a promising pathway for low-temperature, large-scale ethane upgrading. However, under Cl2-rich conditions, LaOCl undergoes detrimental chlorination into lanthanum chloride (LaCl3), accompanied by extensive surface hydroxylation. Such severe structural evolution limits the practical application of La-based catalysts under industrially relevant conditions. In this study, an alumina-stabilized La catalyst was prepared via a coprecipitation method. We demonstrated that strong La-O-Al interactions effectively resist structural degradation of La species under reaction conditions, enabling the modified catalyst to maintain exceptional stability under high Cl2 concentrations. At a C2H6/Cl2 ratio of 4:9, the optimized catalyst achieves an ethane conversion of 61%, with 1,2-dichloroethane selectivity sustained above 74% for 12 h without noticeable deactivation. In contrast, the bulk LaOCl counterpart suffers from rapid over-chlorination, shifting product dominance to trichloroethane within 10 h.

    "abstract": "1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE), a synthetic halohydrocarbon, can cause toxic encephalopathy in workers exposed to it as an industrial solvent. Crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia with proinflammatory phenotype triggered and amplified neuroinflammation, leading to brain edema in 1,2-DCE intoxicated mice. Chemokine fractalkine (FKN) affects neuroinflammation via regulating microglial activation during the course of brain disorders. However, roles of FKN signaling axis in 1,2-DCE-induced neuroinflammation remains unknown. In this study, roles and possible mechanisms of FKN signaling axis on microglial hyperactivation and neuroinflammation were investigated by constructing the mouse model of 1,2-DCE intoxication. We found that FKN signaling axis in the brains was potentiated at early stage of intoxication, but suppressed at late stage. FKN signaling axis potentiated by overexpressing FKN and CX3CR1 or treatment with low dose sFKN alleviated pro-inflammatory polarization, and enhanced anti-inflammatory polarization of microglia, thereby attenuated neuroinflammation. Besides, overexpressing FKN and CX3CR1 also alleviated astrocytic hyperactivation. Contrastly, treatment with high dose sFKN failed to attenuate proinflammatory polarization, whereas suppressed anti-inflammatory polarization of microglia, thereby enhanced neuroinflammation. Further in vitro experiments revealed that exposure to 2-CE (a metabolite of 1,2-DCE in vivo) disrupted the homeostasis of adenosine receptor expression in microglia, resulting in the downregulation of A1R and the upregulation of A2aR. This disruption caused the pro-inflammatory activation of microglia and subsequent neuroinflammatory responses through excessive activation of the A2aR mediated adenosine signaling pathway. Collectively, FKN signaling axis plays divergent roles on the activation of microglial hyperactivation and neuroinflammation in 1,2-DCE intoxicated mice, which may be linked to its distinct impacts on the expression of A1R and A2aR in microglia.",

This study conducted an analysis of pollutant sources and health risks associated with VOCs in gearbox remanufacturing plants. A method for prioritising air pollution control based on health risks and environmental impacts, alongside offering suggestions for VOC prevention and control from an environmental standpoint is established. Using the Positive Definite Matrix Factor (PMF) model, pollutant source analysis of VOCs in the plant identified five primary sources of pollution: waste transmission lubricant, carburetor cleaner, rust remover, ultrasonic cleaning water, and new transmission lubricant. Health risk evaluation revealed that the carcinogenic risk of VOCs in seven key process areas exceeds acceptable thresholds. It was observed that areas such as the disintegration area, case cleaning area, and parts inspection area pose higher carcinogenic risks, and benzene, ethylbenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and trichloromethane were identified as key contributors. Except for the staging area and parts cleaning area, the processes’ locations pose noncarcinogenic health risks to humans, with the sandblasting area showing the highest risk, primarily due to toluene and methylene chloride. Furthermore, a screening method identified ten priority VOCs for control in remanufacturing plants, including methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, and ethylbenzene.

Computations employing density functional theory (DFT) reveal that conjugation between these moieties stabilizes syn-conformers with two HB centers located on the same side of the molecule. Anti-conformers form stronger intermolecular HBs with DMSO and DMF than syn-conformers, and this influences the energy gap between syn- and anti-forms, especially upon excitation of the molecules to the S1 state. Substituents introduced in various positions of the molecules modify their conformational behavior, and mutual disposition of excited singlet states relative to the ground states. Various substitution patterns produce very different effects on relative quantum yield of luminescence: from a moderate increase in polar DMSO and DMF relative to 1,2-dichloroethane solutions to complete quenching of emission which is observable in polar media.

    "abstract": "Abstract Organic dyes with photoluminescence in the second near‐infrared window (NIR‐II, 1000–1700 nm) are promising for bioimaging and optoelectronic devices. Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is a direct measure of their performance. Integrating sphere technology is effective in determining the absolute PLQY. However, the low PLQY values of most NIR‐II organic fluorophores lead to significant measurement errors. Therefore, the most common method for PLQY determination is a relative approach using a photoluminescence spectrometer and a standard reference like IR‐26. Although the relative method enables precise calculation of the PLQY ratio between the sample and the reference, the specific PLQY value of IR‐26 is not clearly defined and is reported to range from 0.05% to 0.50%. Such a deviation can cause significant errors in relative PLQY measurements. In this study, it is reported that a bright organic fluorophore called TPE‐BBT exhibits a high PLQY of 3.94% in THF, which can be accurately measured using a commercially available integrating sphere. Using TPE‐BBT as a standard, the PLQY values of IR‐26 in 1,2‐dichloroethane and IR‐1061 in dichloromethane are accurately determined to be 0.0284% and 0.182%, respectively.

To date, the participation of imidazole in human metabolism, especially in the biosynthesis of natural purine bases of RNA and DNA, has been proven. Benzimidazole is one of the most used compound in medical chemistry. The various derivatives of substances, that exhibit analgesic, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antiviral activities were synthesized based on benzimidazole. This fact paves the way for the synthesis of antimetabolites, which can delay biosynthesis during biotransformation and inhibit the growth of malignant tumors. Thus, in the present work, the interaction of complex compounds with a single cluster fragment of Re 2 6+ (NBu 4 ) 2 Re 2 Cl 8 and trans-tetrachlorodi-μ-alkylcarboxylates of dirhenium(III) with representatives of the azole class – imidazole and benzimidazole was studied under various conditions.

The starting materials were (NBu4)2Re2Cl8 and the selected azoles at a molar ratio of 1:10. The yield of the target compounds was 67-75%. We also investigated the reaction between trans-tetrachloridi-μ-alkylcarboxylates of dirhenium(III) and indicated azoles in a non-donor solvent (1,2-dichloroethane) in inert atmosphere at a molar ratio of reactants of 1:20. As a result of the interaction, complex compounds of the general formula (XH) 2 Re 2 Cl 8 (X – imidazole, benzimidazole) are formed, in which azoles are cations. The yield of reaction products was 83-87%. All target substances are synthesized, isolated in individual state, their spectral properties are investigated.

In Indonesia, the demand for raw materials to produce plastics, especially PVC, continues to grow each year. The chosen method is the direct chlorination of ethylene, resulting in the production of 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC). The process involves two conversion reactors, the CRV-100 and CRV-101. The CRV-100 reactor produces EDC vapor and some EDC compounds. However, these compounds are often not recovered and are released into the atmosphere. To increase efficiency and yield the process by recycling maximize the reactants, the EDC feedstock is replenished by recycling the top product from the CRV-100 reactor.

No such amplification is observed in case of the transfer of TEA+ in either direction. The potential range of the interfacial instability, as well as of its absence, is correctly predicted by the linear instability analysis developed by Aogaki et al. (Electrochim. Acta 23 (1978) 867). The analysis also provides an explanation for the experimentally observed decrease of the interfacial tension in the potential range of the instability. Two remarkable effects of the interfacial instability are demonstrated, specifically the irregularly repeated swapping of the faradaic current and the interfacial tension occurring close to the electrocapillary maximum between the amplified current/low interfacial tension and diffusion current/high interfacial tension levels, and the mechanical oscillation of the electrolyte drop in the former state.",

    "abstract": "Chlorinated hydrocarbons are widely used as solvents and synthetic intermediates, but their chemical persistence can cause hazardous environmental accumulation. Haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus (DhlA) is a bacterial enzyme that naturally converts toxic chloroalkanes into less harmful alcohols. Using a multiscale approach based on the empirical valence bond method, we investigate the catalytic mechanism of 1,2-dichloroethane dehalogenation within DhlA and its mutants. The reaction proceeds through two chemical steps: a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution followed by hydrolysis to form the alcohol. Our simulations accurately reproduce experimentally observed activation barriers for both steps and reveal how specific amino acids influence catalytic efficiency. While the catalytic D124-H289-D260 triad is well established, our results show that secondary active-site residues affect the reaction rates by shaping an electrostatic network that controls a trade-off between the two chemical steps. This interplay means that improving one step may compromise the other, highlighting the complexity of enzyme optimization. Guided by extensive experimental data alongside generative AI predictions, we propose a multiple mutant with the potential for enhanced overall biocatalytic performance. These findings deepen the mechanistic understanding of DhlA and provide a predictive framework for the rational design of improved dehalogenases, with promising applications in biocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA) transports emissions from the rapidly industrializing nations in Asia into the tropical upper troposphere. Here, we present a unique set of measurements on over 100 air samples collected on multiple flights of the M55 Geophysica high altitude research aircraft over the Mediterranean, Nepal, and Northern India during the summers of 2016 and 2017 as part of the European Union project StratoClim. These air samples were measured for 27 ozone‐depleting substances (ODSs), many of which were enhanced above expected levels, including the chlorinated very short‐lived substances, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), 1,2‐dichloroethane (CH2ClCH2Cl), and chloroform (CHCl3). CH2Cl2 mixing ratios in the tropopause region were 65–136 parts per trillion (ppt) in comparison to previous estimates of mixing ratios in the tropical tropopause layer of 30–44 ppt in 2013–2014. Backward trajectories, calculated with the trajectory module of the chemistry‐transport model CLaMS and driven by the ERA5 reanalysis, indicate possible source regions of CH2Cl2 in South Asia. We derived total equivalent chlorine (ECl), and equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) and found that these quantities were substantially higher than previous estimates in the literature. EESC at mean age‐of‐air of 3 years based on the 2016 measurements was 1,861–1,872 ppt in comparison to a previously estimated EESC of 1,646 ppt. Our findings show that the ASMA transports larger than expected mixing ratios of long‐lived and very short‐lived ODSs into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, likely leading to an impact on the stratospheric ozone layer.",

Photocatalytic activity has been recognized as an efficient strategy in removing various types of VOCs. Owing to its compatibility to be conducted under mild condition, photocatalytic reaction is also favorable. Performance of TiO2, a widely applied photocatalyst, can be improved by the doping of various metal elements, like Sr and Cr. Besides, the doping process might also promote the suitability of photocatalyst to be operated under visible light. This study explored performance of various ratios of Sr/TiO2 and Cr/TiO2 under illumination of UV light. 0.01 %Sr/TiO2 achieved the best DCE removal and was further applied examination using various temperatures, along with concentration of DCE and O2. The presence of O2 played an important role during the photocatalytic reaction. Characterization, reaction kinetics study, and analysis of byproducts were also investigated in this study.

    "abstract": "Abstract Radical‐mediated chlorination of ethane presents a low‐carbon alternative for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) synthesis, yet selectivity toward 1,2‐dichloroethane remains challenged by uncontrolled over‐chlorination. Lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) has emerged as a promising catalyst, but its structural dynamics under Cl2‐rich conditions and the origin of selectivity loss remain elusive. Here, we integrate advanced spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations to address this knowledge gap. Our findings unveil a sequential LaOCl → LaCl3 transformation that dictates product distribution shifting from 1,2‐dichloroethane to trichloroethane. Mechanistic insights reveal that surface hydroxyl groups, generated during catalyst chlorination, promote bidentate adsorption of 1,2‐dichloroethane via hydrogen‐bond networks, thereby activating C─Cl over‐chlorination. Additionally, by employing Al2O3‐supported LaCl3 model catalysts, the size‐dependent chlorophilicity of the LaCl3 species is demonstrated. The bonding of interfacial oxygen with monolayer‐dispersed LaCl3 species generates empty 4f‐states above the Fermi level, creating strong Lewis acid sites that stabilize Cl radicals and selectively convert chloroethane to 1,2‐dichloroethane. In contrast, aggregated nanoparticles are inactive due to their inability to stabilize chlorine radical. Our findings establish important structure sensitivity in lanthanum‐catalyzed chlorination and provide guiding principles for catalyst design, highlighting the importance of stabilizing metastable LaOCl x species and modulating surface hydroxyl chemistry to overcome selectivity limitations.",

The ion association between MTX and zwitterionic polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers with peripheral carboxy groups was also investigated in terms of the effects of pH and dendritic generation. The monovalent HMTX+ interacted effectively with the negatively charged dendrimers at neutral pH, while the divalent H2MTX2+ exhibited a weak association under acidic conditions. The higher stability of the dendrimer-MTX associates in the interfacial region was found for higher dendritic generations: G3.5 ≥ G2.5 > G1.5. The interfacial behavior of MTX and its dendrimer associates was further analyzed at the phospholipid-modified interface as a model biomembrane surface. The adsorption process of HMTX+ occurred mainly on the hydrophilic side of the phospholipid layer.

Here, we report on the cofactor versatility or selectivity of Desulfitobacterium RDases produced either in the native organism or heterologously. The susceptibility of Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain DCB‐2 to guided Cba biosynthesis (i.e. incorporation of exogenous Cba lower ligand base precursors) was analysed. Exogenous benzimidazoles, azabenzimidazoles and 4,5‐dimethylimidazole were incorporated by the organism into Cbas. When the type of Cba changed, no effect on the turnover rate of the 3‐chloro‐4‐hydroxy‐phenylacetate‐converting enzyme RdhA6 and the 3,5‐dichlorophenol‐dehalogenating enzyme RdhA3 was observed. The impact of the amendment of Cba lower ligand precursors on RDase function was also investigated in Shimwellia blattae, the Cba producer used for the heterologous production of Desulfitobacterium RDases. The recombinant tetrachloroethene RDase (PceAY51) appeared to be non‐selective towards different Cbas. However, the functional production of the 1,2‐dichloroethane‐dihaloeliminating enzyme (DcaA) of Desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans was completely prevented in cells producing 5,6‐dimethylbenzimidazolyl‐Cba, but substantially enhanced in cells that incorporated 5‐methoxybenzimidazole into the Cba cofactor.

Patients with acute intoxications by AHH received an innovative treatment. Methods: Analyzed were data of 60 patients intoxicated by AHH, such as dichloromethane (n = 3), chloroform (n = 2), carbon tetrachloride (n = 12), 1,2-dichloroethane (n = 18), 1,1,2-trichloroethane (n = 2), trichloroethylene (n = 2), tetrachloroethylene (n = 13) or mixed AHH chemicals (n = 8), who received a new treatment consisting of CO2-induced hyperventilation to accelerate toxin removal via the lungs. Results: Added to the inspiration air at a flow rate of 2–3 Liter min−1, CO2 increased the respiratory volume up to 25–30 Liter min−1, ensuring forced AHH exhalation. This CO2-induced hyperventilation therapy was commonly well tolerated by the 60 patients and lasted for 106.0±10.5 hours. In most cases, initially increased liver test results of aminotransferases normalized quickly under the therapy, and liver histology obtained at completion of the therapy revealed, in the majority of patients, normal findings or fatty changes, and rarely severe single cell necrosis but no confluent liver cell necrosis. Despite therapy, clinical outcome was unfavorable for 4/60 patients (6.7%) of the study cohort, due to single or combined risk factors. These included late initiation of the CO2-induced hyperventilation therapy, intentional intoxication, uptake of high amounts of AHH, concomitant ingestion of overdosed drugs, consumption of high amounts of alcohol, and history of alcohol abuse. Conclusions: For intoxications by AHH, effective therapy approaches including forced hyperventilation to increase toxin removal via the lungs are available and require prompt initiation.",

Regioselectivity was determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR.ResultsCoupling of 3-benzylsufanyl-5-(1H-indolyl)-1,2,4-triazole with dibromomethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,3-dibromopropane and di(bromomethyl)quinoxaline was investigated in the presence of potassium carbonate in acetone. In the case of dibromomethane three different bis(triazolyl)methane isomers (–N1–CH2–N1-4, –N1–CH2–N2-5, –N2–CH2–N2-6) were formed in which the two bromide atoms were replaced by two triazole moieties. Among these isomers the reaction was regioselective towards the –N1–CH2–N2-5 isomer due to the steric effect. In the case of 1,3-dibromopropane two compounds were obtained due to the alkylation at N(2) to give 2-(3-bromopropyl)-triazole 8 and alkylation at N(1) was followed by cyclization at the indole nitrogen to form a condensed indolo-triazolo-diazepine 10.

Dual element isotope analysis subsequently linked insights from our model system to microbial reductive dehalogenation. Identical observed isotope effects in reduction of trichloromethane by Dehalobacter CF and cobalamin (Dehalobacter CF, εC = -27.9 ± 1.7‰; εCl = -4.2 ± 0.‰; λ = 6.6 ± 0.1; cobalamin, εC = -26.0 ± 0.9‰; εCl = -4.0 ± 0.2‰; λ = 6.5 ± 0.2) indicated the same underlying mechanism, as did identical isotope effects in the reduction of 1,2-dichloroethane by Dehalococcoides and cobalamin (Dehalococcoides, εC = -33.0 ± 0.4‰; εCl = -5.1 ± 0.1‰; λ = 6.5 ± 0.2; cobalamin, εC = -32.8 ± 1.7‰; εCl = -5.1 ± 0.2‰; λ = 6.4 ± 0.2).

    "abstract": "Ru-based catalysts for catalytic combustion of high-toxicity Cl-containing volatile organic compounds are inclined to produce Cl2 instead of ideal HCl due to the Deacon reaction. We herein reported that the three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) WOx-supported RuP nanocatalyst greatly improved HCl selectivity (at 400 °C, increased from 66.0% over Ru/3DOM WOx to 96.4% over RuP/3DOM WOx) and reduced chlorine-containing byproducts for 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) oxidation. P-doping enhanced the number of structural hydroxyl groups and Brønsted acid sites. The isotopic 1,2-DCE temperature-programmed desorption experiment in the presence of H218O indicated the generation of a new active oxygen species 16O18O that participated in the reaction. Generally, P-doping and H2O introduction could promote the exchange reaction between Cl and hydroxyl groups, rather than oxygen defects, and then benefit the production of HCl and reduce the generation of other chlorine species or Cl2, via the reaction processes of C2H3Cl → alcohol → aldehyde → carboxylic acids.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEmulsification of oils at liquid/liquid interfaces is of fundamental importance across a range of applications, including detergency. Adsorption and partitioning of the anionic surface active ions at the interface between two immiscible solutions is known to cause predictable chaos at the transfer potential region of the surfactant. In this work, the phenomenon that leads to the chaotic behaviour shown by sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) at the water/1,2‐dichloroethane interface is applied to commercial surfactants and aqueous/glyceryl trioleate interface. Electrochemical methods, electrocapillary curves, optical microscopy and conductivity measurements demonstrated that at 1.5 mm of SDBS, surfactants are adsorbed at the interface and assemble into micelles, leading to interfacial instability. As the concentration of the anionic surfactant was enhanced to 8 and 13.4 mm, the Marangoni effect and the interfacial emulsification became more prominent. The chaotic behaviour was found to be dependent on the surfactant concentration and the electrolytes present.",

    "abstract": "Chloroform and trichloroethanes are pervasive groundwater contaminants for which bioremediation has been an effective treatment strategy. Reductive dehalogenase (RDase) enzymes from organohalide-respiring bacteria are essential for their remediation under anaerobic conditions. RDases are responsible for dehalogenating these chlorinated solvents, leading to their removal. This work explores the kinetic characteristics of three closely related Dehalobacter chloroalkane-reductases—TmrA, CfrA, and AcdA—and identifies differences between their activity on chloroform (CF), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), and 1,1,2-TCA. The side-by-side comparison of these enzymes has emphasized that TmrA and AcdA are specialized toward CF with both having 4-fold higher maximum specific activity (Vmax) on CF than 1,1,1-TCA, whereas, CfrA has very similar rates on both CF and 1,1,1-TCA. AcdA is the most sensitive to substrate inhibition by CF and 1,1,2-TCA, and inhibition by a common co-contaminant trichloroethene. Finally, the reduction of 1,1,2-TCA, which can produce both 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, was assessed for each enzyme. Interestingly, each enzyme has a distinct preference for the major product it produces, indicating a favoured reaction pathway. Despite over 95% sequence identity, TmrA, CfrA, and AcdA exhibit substantial differences in kinetic behaviour, highlighting the importance of understanding such nuances for informed bioremediation strategies.

To explore whether aberrant miRNA expression is involved in liver abnormalities mediated by 1,2‐DCE exposure, we examined alterations in miRNA expression patterns in the livers of NIH Swiss mice after dynamic inhalation exposure to 350 or 700 mg m–3 1,2‐DCE for 28 days. Using a microarray chip, we discovered that only mmumiR‐451a was significantly upregulated in the liver tissue of mice exposed to 700 mg m–3 1,2‐DCE; this finding was validated by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction. In vitro study revealed that it was metabolite 2‐chloroacetic acid, not 1,2‐DCE that resulted in the upregulation of mmu‐miR‐451a in the mouse AML12 cell line. Furthermore, our data showed that the upregulation of mmu‐miR‐451a induced by 2‐chloroacetic acid could suppress the expression of glycerol kinase and lead to the inhibition of glycerol gluconeogenesis in mouse liver tissue and AML12 cells. These observations provide evidence that hepatic mmu‐miR‐451a responds to 1,2‐DCE exposure and might induce glucose metabolism disorders by suppressing the glycerol gluconeogenesis process.",

Assessment protocols acknowledge the need to remove these products during VI investigations, but they can be problematic to identify and locate. Predicting if the products cause detectable air concentrations is also difficult since emission rate information is limited and can vary with product use and age. In this study, the emission rates of 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, and carbon tetrachloride from four consumer products identified as indoor sources during VI field investigations were measured under laboratory conditions using a flow through system. Emissions of PCE from an adhesive container tube ranged from 1.33 ± 1.13 μg/min (unopened) to 23.9 ± 2.93 μg/min (previously opened). The laboratory-measured emission rates were used to estimate indoor air concentrations, which were then compared to concentrations measured after the products placed were into an actual residence. The estimated and measured indoor air concentrations were generally comparable, showing that emission rate information can be used to determine the relative impact of internal CVOC sources.",

    "abstract": "Excessive exposure to 1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE), a chlorinated organic toxicant, can lead to liver dysfunction. To fully explore the mechanism of 1,2-DCE-induced hepatic abnormalities, 30 male National Institutes of Health (NIH) Swiss mice were exposed to 0, 350, or 700mg/m3 of 1,2-DCE, via inhalation, 6h/day for 28days. Increased liver/body weight ratios, as well as serum AST and serum ALT activity were observed in the 350 and 700mg/m3 1,2-DCE exposure group mice, compared with the control group mice. In addition, decreased body weights were observed in mice exposed to 700mg/m3 1,2-DCE, compared with control mice. Exposure to 350 and 700mg/m3 1,2-DCE also led to significant accumulation of hepatic glycogen, free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides, elevation of blood triglyceride and FFA levels, and decreases in blood glucose levels. Results from microarray analysis indicated that the decreases in glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC) and liver glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL) expression, mediated by the activation of AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (Akt1), might be responsible for the hepatic glycogen accumulation and steatosis. Further in vitro study demonstrated that 2-chloroacetic acid (1,2-DCE metabolite), rather than 1,2-DCE, up-regulated Akt1 phosphorylation and suppressed G6PC and PYGL expression, resulting in hepatocellular glycogen accumulation. These results suggest that hepatic glucose and lipid homeostasis are impaired by 1,2-DCE exposure via down-regulation of PYGL and G6PC expression, which may be primarily mediated by the 2-chloroacetic acid-activated Akt1 pathway.",

    "abstract": "\n <p>The metropolis of Lille (more than 1 million inhabitants) produces 40% of its drinking water through well fields tapping the chalk aquifer to the agricultural, urban, and industrial region southwest of Lille. The groundwater quality is threatened by the presence of chlorinated solvents amongst others pollutants. In fact, many industries using chlorinated solvents are or were established on the well field&#8217;s territory as paint factories, industrial laundries and metallurgical plants. The chlorinated solvent concentrations in groundwater often exceed the regulation limit for drinking water usage in France ([perchloroethene] + [trichloroethene] < 10 &#181;g.L<sup>-1</sup>) and then limit its use for drinking water production. The understanding of the chlorinated solvents dynamics and space distribution in the aquifer is a major issue for the metropolis of Lille. In addition, the quantities of available water with good quality is currently decreasing due to repeated annual droughts in the recent years. Thus, the metropolis of Lille, the French Geological Survey and the University of Lille explored the transfer and degradation mechanisms of the chlorinated solvents in the well fields in the two research projects RESEAU (2016-2019) and COHMET (2017-2020).</p><p>18 wells and 9 piezometers were sampled during 3 years in order to evaluate the chlorinated solvents concentrations. In order to assess a possible migration of the compounds, three piezometers were sampled along the water column using passive samplers. In addition, a more detailed hydrochemical characterisation of groundwaters (chemical elements markers of the reducing conditions, physico-chemical parameters) was performed in the same three piezometers. Furthermore, the possible chlorinated solvent sources were identified with the databases BASIAS and BASOL, which list the past and current industrial plants, polluted soils and sites on the French territory. Finally, the chlorinated solvent degradation mechanisms were investigated with a compound-specific carbon isotope analysis.</p><p>The three-year concentration monitoring highlights complex dynamics of the chlorinated solvents in the aquifer. A wide variety of compounds is detected in the well fields (perchloroethene, trichloroethene, cis and trans-1,2-dichloroethene, 1,1-dichloroethene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride) with maximal concentrations ranging from 1.2 (vinyl chloride) to 155 &#181;g.L<sup>-1</sup> (cis-1,2-dichloroethene). The highest concentrations are measured downstream three former industrial laundries in the south of the territory. The chlorinated solvent concentrations are stratified along the wells water columns and increased with depth. These concentration increases are consistent with water inlets along the wells originated from the fractured chalk. Despite the measure of favourable physico-chemical conditions, the &#948;<sup>13</sup>C ratios comparison do not indicate biodegradation of the chlorinated solvents, except in two wells. The concentrations changes are essentially due to the migration of compounds in depth. Then, the &#948;<sup>13</sup>C ratios indicate the presence of several major sources of chlorinated solvents.</p>\n",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Solute-solvent systems are an important topic of study, as the effects of the solvent on the solute can drastically change its properties. Theoretical studies of these systems are done with ab initio methods, molecular simulations or a combination of both. The simulations of molecular systems are usually performed with either molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Classical MD has evolved much in the last decades, both in algorithms and implementations, having several stable and efficient codes developed and available. Similarly, MC methods have also evolved, focusing mainly in creating and improving methods and implementations in available codes. In this paper, we provide some enhancements to a Configurational Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) methodology to simulate flexible molecules using the molecular fragments concept. In our implementation the acceptance criterion of the CBMC method was simplified and a generalization was proposed to allow the simulation of molecules with any kind of fragments. We also introduce the new version of DICE, a MC code for molecular simulation (available at https://portal.if.usp.br/dice). This code was mainly developed to simulate solute-solvent systems in liquid and gas phases and in interfaces (gas-liquid and solid-liquid) that has been mostly used to generate configurations for a sequential quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method (S-QM/MM). This new version introduces several improvements over the previous ones, with the ability of simulating flexible molecules with CBMC as one of them. Simulations of well known molecules, such as n-octane and 1,2-dichloroethane in vacuum and in solution, are presented to validate the new implementations comparing with MD simulations, experimental data and other theoretical results. The efficiency of the conformational sampling was analyzed using the acceptance rates of different alkanes: n-octane, neopentane and 4-ethylheptane. Furthermore, a very complex molecule, the boron subphtalocyanine, was simulated in vacuum and in aqueous solution showing the versatility of the new implementation. We show that the CBMC is a very good method to perform conformation sampling of complex moderate sized molecules (up to 150 atoms) in solution following the Boltzmann thermodynamic equilibrium distribution.",

However, the high price of spiro-OMeTAD is an obstacle faced in its research and commercialization. In our previous work, we introduced a low-cost HTM, (E,E,E,E)-4,4′,4″,4‴-[Benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrakis(ethene-2,1-diyl)]tetrakis[N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline] (α2); however, it was immiscible in the conventional solvent chlorobenzene, leading to the adoption of dichloromethane (DCM) as an alternative. Nevertheless, its high vapor pressure led to poor reproducibility, limiting its practical applicability. To address this issue, we investigated alternative solvents to DCM to facilitate the application of α2 to dichloride alkane materials, from 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) to 1,4-dichlorobutane. In these materials, DCE exhibits the most superior properties in terms of layer formation control, due to its vapor pressure in spin-coating. Accordingly, a PSC containing α2-DCE HTL showed high performance, with 1.15V of open-circuit voltage and a 22.7% power conversion efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Very short‐lived substances (VSLS), including dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), perchloroethylene (C2Cl4), and 1,2‐dichloroethane (C2H4Cl2), are a stratospheric chlorine source and therefore contribute to ozone depletion. We quantify stratospheric chlorine trends from these VSLS (VSLCltot) using a chemical transport model and atmospheric measurements, including novel high‐altitude aircraft data from the NASA VIRGAS (2015) and POSIDON (2016) missions. We estimate VSLCltot increased from 69 (±14) parts per trillion (ppt) Cl in 2000 to 111 (±22) ppt Cl in 2017, with >80% delivered to the stratosphere through source gas injection, and the remainder from product gases. The modeled evolution of chlorine source gas injection agrees well with historical aircraft data, which corroborate reported surface CH2Cl2 increases since the mid‐2000s. The relative contribution of VSLS to total stratospheric chlorine increased from ~2% in 2000 to ~3.4% in 2017, reflecting both VSLS growth and decreases in long‐lived halocarbons. We derive a mean VSLCltot growth rate of 3.8 (±0.3) ppt Cl/year between 2004 and 2017, though year‐to‐year growth rates are variable and were small or negative in the period 2015–2017. Whether this is a transient effect, or longer‐term stabilization, requires monitoring. In the upper stratosphere, the modeled rate of HCl decline (2004–2017) is −5.2% per decade with VSLS included, in good agreement to ACE satellite data (−4.8% per decade), and 15% slower than a model simulation without VSLS. Thus, VSLS have offset a portion of stratospheric chlorine reductions since the mid‐2000s.",

For comparison, monometallic Ag/γ-Al2O3 and Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared using the impregnation method. Gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane to ethylene was investigated on those catalysts. The structures and chemical compositions of bimetallic Pd-Ag particles in the catalysts were controlled by adjusting Pd replacement amount. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy of CO adsorption. The results demonstrated that contiguous Pd sites dominated in the monometallic Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, while Pd atoms were separately decorated on the surface of Ag particles in the bimetallic Pd-Ag/γ-Al2O3 catalysts when Pd replacement amount was below 0.30wt.%. At Pd replacement amount of 0.30wt.%, Pd ensembles with contiguous Pd sites developed in the bimetallic catalyst.

However, efficient fabrication of high-quality tBLG with diverse twist angles is crucial to expedite research on angle-dependent physics and potential applications. In this study, an intercalation strategy utilizing organic molecules, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, is developed to weaken the interlayer interaction and induce slide or rotation of the topmost graphene layer for tBLG fabrication. The proportion of tBLGs in the resulting 1,2-dichloroethane-treated BLG (dtBLG) reaches up to 84.4% for twist angles ranging from 0° to 30°, surpassing previously reported methods using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Moreover, the twist angle distribution is not uniform and tends to concentrate in the ranges of 0-10° and 20-30°. This facile and rapid intercalation-based methodology provides a practical solution for studying angle-dependent physics and advancing the utilization of twisted two-dimensional materials.",

    "year": 2018,
    "abstract": "Attempts to establish an absolute single-ion hydration free energy scale have followed multiple strategies. Two central themes consist of (1) employing bulk pair thermodynamic data and an underlying interfacial-potential-free model to partition the hydration free energy into individual contributions [Marcus, Latimer, and tetraphenyl-arsonium/tetraphenyl-borate (TATB) methods] or (2) utilizing bulk thermodynamic and cluster data to estimate the free energy to insert a proton into water, including in principle an interfacial potential contribution [the cluster pair approximation (CPA)]. While the results for the hydration free energy of the proton agree remarkably well between the three approaches in the first category, the value differs from the CPA result by roughly +10 kcal/mol, implying a value for the effective electrochemical surface potential of water of -0.4 V. This paper provides a computational re-analysis of the TATB method for single-ion free energies using quasichemical theory. A previous study indicated a significant discrepancy between the free energies of hydration for the TA cation and the TB anion. We show that the main contribution to this large computed difference is an electrostatic artifact arising from modeling interactions in periodic boundaries. No attempt is made here to develop more accurate models for the local ion/solvent interactions that may lead to further small free energy differences between the TA and TB ions, but the results clarify the primary importance of interfacial potential effects for analysis of the various free energy scales. Results are also presented, related to the TATB assumption in the organic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide and 1,2-dichloroethane.",

Herein, an iodine‐catalyzed C3–H sulfinylation strategy is presented for the synthesis of 3‐sulfinylindoles, employing sulfenamides as stable and odorless sulfenylating reagents. This protocol proceeds under mild conditions (100 °C in 1,2‐dichloroethane) without extra oxidants or additives, delivering a broad range of 3‐sulfinylindole derivatives in moderate to excellent yields. Substrate scope investigations demonstrate excellent compatibility with indoles having electron‐donating/withdrawing groups and sulfenamides containing aromatic/heterocyclic groups.

The selective excitation of interfacial species in PM-TIRF measurements elucidated the potential-induced aggregation mechanism of the porphyrins. The J-aggregates of H4TPPS2- were reversibly formed only at the water|DCE interface by applying appropriate potentials even when the porphyrins exist as monomers in the aqueous and organic solutions. In the H2PP2- system, the slow aggregation process was found in the negative potential region. The spectral characteristics and the signal phase of PM-TIRF indicated that the H2PP2- monomers were adsorbed with relatively standing orientation and that the long axis of the J-aggregates was nearly in plane of the interface. H2PP2- was also investigated at the biomimetic phospholipid-adsorbed water|DCE interface. The competitive adsorption of neutral glycerophospholipids effectively inhibited the potential-dependent adsorption and interfacial aggregation processes of H2PP2-.

Bioremediation interventions are site specific and generally based on anaerobic pathways, nevertheless expanding knowledge on proper conditions favoring the biodegradation and especially on 1,2-DCA degrading microorganisms is crucial. In this work the intrinsic biodegradation potential of an aquifer impacted by Chlorinated Aliphatic Hydrocarbons (mainly 1,2-DCA) was evaluated by characterizing the aquifer microbiome across space and time and by setting up biostimulation treatments in microcosms under different aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in parallel. The microbial profiling of the aquifer revealed noticeable alpha and beta diversity across the sampling sites within the aquifer and strong fluctuations over time. Surprisingly both the anaerobic and aerobic biostimulation treatments led to the successful removal of 1,2-DCA in microcosms, the enrichment of known 1,2-DCA degraders and the detection of reductive or hydrolytic dehalogenases. Ancylobacter and Starkeya were enriched in aerobic microcosms. Desulfovibrio and Desulfuromonas, known as perchloroethylene degraders, were enriched in anaerobic microcosms, suggesting they could be yet unknown 1,2-DCA respirers. Our results demonstrate the occurrence of both aerobic and anaerobic bioremediation potential in the aquifer despite its negative redox potential.

We present a theoretical approach to investigate the catalytic power of the haloalkane dehalogenase reaction with 1,2-dichloroethane. By removing the three main active-site residues one by one from haloalkane dehalogenase, we found two reactive descriptors: one descriptor is the distance difference between the breaking bond and the forming bond, and the other is the charge difference between the transition state and the reactant complex. Both descriptors scale linearly with the reactive barriers, with the three-residue case having the smallest barrier and the zero-residue case having the largest. The results demonstrate that, as the number of residues increases, the catalytic power increases. The predicted free energy barriers using the two descriptors of this reaction in water are 23.1 and 24.2 kcal/mol, both larger than the ones with any residues, indicating that the water solvent hinders the reactivity. Both predicted barrier heights agree well with the calculated one at 25.2 kcal/mol using a quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics approach, and also agree well with the experimental result at 26.0 kcal/mol.

Through the five-step screening method, the suitable catalysts, respectively, applicable to the generation of vinyl chloride (CH2CHCl), ethylene (CH2CH2), and ethane (CH3CH3) were finally determined. The limiting potential of Fe@TGCN for reducing 1,2-DCE to CH3CH3 is lower, at -0.47 V (gauche-C2H4Cl2) and -0.50 V (trans-C2H4Cl2), respectively. The activity mechanism indicates that Fe@TGCN is at the vertex of the volcano plot, confirming that the intensity of its interaction with the reactants is in optimal equilibrium. In addition, we further examined the influence of hydroxyl modification on the selectivity of DCEDR.

The conductance data show that in all solvent systems, the stoichiometry of the complex formed between (DB14C4) and ZrO2+ cation is 1:1 (M:L). The stability order of (DB 14C4.ZrO)2+complex in pure non-aqueous solvents was found to be: [AN], [DCE], [MeOH], [THF], [DMF]. A non-linear behaviour was observed improvements in log Kf of (DB14C4.ZrO)2+ complex or Binary mixed solvent composition, It Was clarified as to the Interactions with solvents and even solvents in terms of the hetero-selective solving of the ecosystem affected by complexation response.

    "abstract": "The study addressed the challenge of treating petroleum industry wastewater with high concentrations of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) ranging from 384 to 1654 mg/L, which poses a challenge for bacterial biodegradation and algal photodegradation. To overcome this, a collaborative approach using membrane bioreactors (MBRs) that combine algae and bacteria was employed. This synergistic method effectively mitigated the toxicity of 1,2-DCA and curbed MBR fouling. Two types of MBRs were tested: one (B-MBR) used bacterial cultures and the other (AB-MBR) incorporated a mix of algal and bacterial cultures. The AB-MBR significantly contributed to 1,2-DCA removal, with algae accounting for over 20% and bacteria for approximately 49.5% of the dechlorination process. 1,2-DCA metabolites, including 2-chloroethanol, 2-chloro-acetaldehyde, 2-chloroacetic acid, and acetic acid, were partially consumed as carbon sources by algae. Operational efficiency peaked at a 12-hour hydraulic retention time (HRT) in AB-MBR, enhancing enzyme activities crucial for 1,2-DCA degradation such as dehydrogenase (DH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The microbial diversity in AB-MBR surpassed that in B-MBR, with a notable increase in Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Planctomycetota, and Verrucomicrobiota. Furthermore, AB-MBR showed a significant rise in the dominance of 1,2-DCA-degrading genus such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Additionally, algal-degrading phyla (e.g., Nematoda, Rotifera, and Streptophyta) were more prevalent in AB-MBR, substantially reducing the issue of membrane fouling.",

The structural X-ray diffraction analysis of 21 different salts revealed the electrophilicity of the Te centers in their interactions with anions. Telluroniums' propensity to form Lewis pairs was investigated with OPPh3. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy suggests that telluroniums may bind up to three OPPh3 molecules. Isotherm titration calorimetry showed that the related heats of association in 1,2-dichloroethane depend on the electronic properties of the substituents of the aryl moiety and on the nature of the counterion. The enthalpies of first association of OPPh3 span -0.5 to -5 kcal/mol. The study of the affinity of telluroniums for OPPh3 by state-of-the-art DFT and ab initio methods reveals the dominant Coulombic and dispersion interactions as well as an entropic effect favoring association in solution. Intermolecular orbital interactions between [Ar2MeTe]+ cations and OPPh3 are deemed insufficient to ensure alone the cohesion of [Ar2MeTe•Bn]+ complexes in solution (B= Lewis base).

    "abstract": "Experimental potentiometric unified pH (pHabs) scale is presented in 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). The scale was compiled using differential potentiometric measurements, carried out by pair-wise comparisons between solutions. Aqueous standard buffer solutions were used as anchor points, so that the obtained pH values are linked to (i.e., are traceable to) the conventional aqueous pH scale and are expressed as values. They are directly comparable to pH values in water in terms of the chemical potential of the solvated proton. The \"ladder\" approach was used for data analysis and values were assigned to 19 solutions in 1,2-DCE, leading to a scale spanning from -2.9 to 11.0. This is the first time that successful potentiometric measurements have been carried out in a solvent of as low polarity as 1,2-DCE. The whole set of measurements, comprising a total of 85 ΔpHabs values, has a consistency standard deviation of 0.17 pH units. This is higher compared to the consistency standard deviations reported in the literature for similar measurements in other solvents and reflects the experimental difficulties with potentiometric measurements in a low-polarity solvent. This result means that potentiometric measurement of values is possible in low-polarity solvents, and it is thus expected that potentiometric measurement is possible in most organic solvents, opening the possibility of experimentally connecting many solvents into the unified scale.",

The throughput to breakthrough was found to be linearly correlated to capacities calculated with single‐solute equilibrium isotherm parameters. Modest decreases, 9–13% on average, in throughput to 50 and 75% breakthrough were found when the EBCT was increased from 7.5 to 15 min.

This method is based on the formation of ion associate complex between Cr(III), KI and Rhodamine B (RhB). The formed complex is floated in the interface of aqueous solution and 1,2-dichloroethane via vigorous shaking. By discarding the aqueous solution and 1,2-dichloroethane, the floated ion associate [(CrI4)−] [(RhB)+] complex on the wall of a separating funnel was then dissolved in a small volume of methanol solvent. By studying different affecting parameters, it was found that the maximum absorbance of the formed ion associate complex was 0.675 at λmax 560 nm. The molar absorptivity of the colour is 9.51 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 at λmax 560 nm and the colour was stable for 1 h. The calibration graph was linear in the concentration range of 0.1–100 mg L−1 of Cr(III). The low limit of detection (LOD) was 0.1 mg L−1. The relative standard deviations (RSD) at 0.1 and 100 mg L−1 of Cr(III) were 4.7% and 7.2% (n = 10), respectively.

The supramolecular gel showed reversible phase transition by repeated warming-cooling cycles accompanying with the gel-sol transitions. The supramolecular gel could undergo five repeated mechano-responsive gel-sol transitions.

    "abstract": "Subacute poisoning of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) has become a serious occupational problem in China, and brain edema is its main pathological consequence, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. As the metabolite of 1,2-DCE, 2-chloroethanol (2-CE) is more reactive, and might play an important role in the toxic effects of 1,2-DCE. In our previous studies, we found that matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) expression was enhanced in mouse brains upon treatment with 1,2-DCE, and in rat astrocytes exposed to 2-CE. In the present study, we analyzed the association of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) with MMP-9 overexpression in astrocytes treated with 2-CE. MMP-9, p65, c-Jun, and c-Fos were significantly upregulated by 2-CE treatment, which also enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun, c-Fos and inhibitor of κBα (IκBα), and nuclear translocation of p65. Furthermore, inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and AP-1 activity with the specific inhibitors could attenuate MMP-9 overexpression in the cells. On the other hand, inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway suppressed the activation of both NF-κB and AP-1 in 2-CE-treated astrocytes. In conclusion, MMP-9 overexpression induced by 2-CE in astrocytes could be mediated at least in part through the p38 signaling pathway via activation of both NF-κB and AP-1. This study might provide novel clues for clarifying the mechanisms underlying 1,2-DCE associated cerebral edema.",

Comprehensive measurements of VOCs were conducted based on U.S. EPA TO-15. Potential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic inhalation risks were evaluated by comparing the measured concentrations with the inhalation unit risk (IUR) and reference concentration (RfC). The results indicated that a high carcinogenic risk occurred from 1,2 dibromoethane and benzene, while non-carcinogenic risks were attributed to 1,3 butadiene, 1,1,2 trichloroethane, and 3-chloropropene. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) Version 5.0 was further utilized to estimate the contribution of specific sources to the VOC mixing ratio. The results revealed that the average VOC concentration in the community area was dominated by aromatic hydrocarbons, with toluene having the highest concentration. Vehicle exhaust was evaluated as the most contributing emission source of the VOC mixing ratio, followed by industrial processes. Specific VOC ratios were also applied to identify VOC sources. The T/B ratio was within the range 3.54–5.15, confirming that vehicle emissions were the main source of pollutants during the entire investigated period in the community area. As for the industrial area, the average VOC concentration was dominated by alkenes. Industrial processes and the petrochemical industry were the major sources of VOCs.

Inspired by the elementary structure/function relationships of biological ion channels embedded in biomembranes, a new strategy is proposed herein to mimic biological K+ channels by using the graphene laminar membrane (GLM) composed of two-dimensional (2D) angstrom(Å)-scale channels to support a simple model of semi-biomembrane, namely oil/water (O/W) interface. It is found that K+ is strongly preferred over Na+ and Li+ for transferring across the GLM-supported water/1,2-dichloroethane (W/DCE) interface within the same potential window (-0.1-0.6 V), although the monovalent ion selectivity of GLM under the aqueous solution is still low (K+/Na+~1.11 and K+/Li+~1.35). Moreover, the voltammetric responses corresponding to the ion transfer of NH4+ observed at the GLM-supported W/DCE interface also show that NH4+ can often pass through the biological K+ channels due to their comparable hydration–free energies and cation-π interactions. The underlying mechanism of as-observed K+ selective voltammetric responses is discussed and found to be consistent with the energy balance of cationic partial-dehydration (energetic costs) and cation-π interaction (energetic gains) as involved in biological K+ channels.",

This work systematically decouples the kinetics of ethane chlorination and chloroethane functionalization under varying Cl2 concentrations, revealing that chlorine radicals govern product distribution through thermodynamically favored pathways. This results in an interesting phenomenon whereby the product ratio between 1,1-C2H4Cl2 and 1,2-C2H4Cl2 maintains a constant 2:1 stoichiometry regardless of Cl2 concentration variation. A critical observation is that the rate of all chlorination steps remains independent of alkane concentrations, highlighting the dominant role of chlorine radicals in rate-determining steps. Furthermore, ethylene byproducts are demonstrated to originate from the dechlorination of chlorine-radical-induced 2-chloroethyl radicals derived from chloroethane, rather than the direct dehydrochlorination of chloroethane itself. These insights into the dual role of chlorine radicals—mediating both the chlorination and dehydrochlorination pathways—establish a foundational framework for integrating gas-phase radical chemistry with catalytic engineering strategies to suppress undesired side reactions and enable scalable, selective ethane chlorination.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The local dimension of toxicity effect on humans and ecosystem from chemical emissions into rural environments is currently not considered in impact characterization models underlying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The aim of the present study was to understand the relevance of considering a local exposure environment for the magnitude of damage related to human toxicity and ecotoxicity impacts associated with chemical emissions into a local environment. Method Unit and realistic European emission scenarios were considered in a proposed multimedia nested box model, based on an existing framework modified with the inclusion of a local scale, and tested for ten chemicals in an illustrative case study. Results A substantial damage increase in terms of characterization factors in the proposed model was found for human health, mainly for local freshwater emissions (up to three orders of magnitude compared to emissions into continental freshwater for naphthalene) and soil emissions (up to two orders of magnitude, in particular for emissions into natural soil for 1,2-dichloroethane). Conclusions Based on our results, we suggest to use the proposed framework in LCA applications, when more specific information about the local emission environment is known. With respect to considering the local-scale, however, spatialized models might be preferable over nested box models to properly capture local phenomena in rather highly densely populated areas.",

These compounds are an environmental concern due to the adverse health effects associated with them and have been detected in environmental matrices including soils and groundwater. Chlorinated alkanes are recalcitrant, and current remediation methods that employ zero-valent iron (ZVI) are unable to directly dehalogenate these compounds, limiting the available approaches for in situ remediation of these widely utilized chemicals. This study employed a novel approach for the remediation of 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP), 1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-DCP), 1,3-dichloropropane (1,3-DCP), 1-chloropropane (1-CP), and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) in the presence of ZVI and vitamin B12, a naturally occurring electron mediator. Batch reactions were performed in order to determine a kinetic model for the associated degradation mechanisms. Dechlorination byproducts were confirmed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled to a purge and trap. Free chloride was quantified by ion chromatography (IC) utilizing suppressed conductivity detection. In the absence of vitamin B12, reductive dechlorination of chlorinated alkanes was observed to not occur when exposed to only reactive ZVI particles (<5 μm). However, in the presence of ZVI combined with vitamin B12, complete reductive dechlorination was observed and followed a pseudo-first-order reaction.",

In this study, N-doped porous carbon supported Ni catalysts (denoted as Ni/NC) were prepared using furfuryl alcohol (FA) loaded Ni-MOF-74 as the precursor followed by NH4OH treatment and pyrolysis under N2 atmosphere. For comparison purpose, Ni catalysts supported on porous carbon (denoted as Ni/C) were also prepared by direct pyrolysis of Ni-MOF-74. The selective gas phase catalytic hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane to ethylene was carried out to evaluate the catalytic performances of the catalysts. It was found that for Ni catalysts prepared at the same pyrolysis temperature, Ni particle sizes in Ni/NC catalysts were significantly smaller (20–40% smaller) than that of Ni/C. This reflected that pre-modification of Ni-MOF-74 using FA and NH4OH could effectively increase Ni dispersion in Ni catalysts derived from Ni-MOF-74. Moreover, Ni/NC had a markedly stronger ability to form spillover H2 owing to the enhanced metal-support interactions by N-doping. Accordingly, Ni/NC catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activities than Ni/C catalysts. The turnover frequencies of Ni/NC catalysts were found to be 1.22–1.65 times higher than Ni/C catalysts. Increasing pyrolysis temperature led to decreased catalytic activities of both Ni/C and Ni/NC catalysts, due to the aggregation of Ni particles at higher treatment temperature. The findings from this study demonstrate that the MOF-mediated synthesis method offers a promising way to prepare Ni-based catalysts for catalytic hydrodechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons.",

However, the extreme bio-impedance of C–Cl bonds means that a high energy input is needed to drive biological dechlorination. Biotechnology techniques based on microbial photoelectrochemical cell (MPEC) could potentially convert solar energy into electricity and significantly reduce the external energy inputs currently needed to treat 1,2-DCA. However, low electricity-generating efficiency at the anode and sluggish bioreaction kinetics at the cathode limit the application of MPEC. In this study, a g-C3N4/Blue TiO2-NTA photoanode was fabricated and incorporated into an MPEC for 1,2-DCA removal. Optimal performance was achieved when Blue TiO2 nanotube arrays (Blue TiO2-NTA) were loaded with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) 10 times. The photocurrent density of the g-C3N4/Blue TiO2-NTA composite electrode was 2.48-fold higher than that of the pure Blue TiO2-NTA electrode under light irradiation. Furthermore, the MPEC equipped with g-C3N4/Blue TiO2-NTA improved 1,2-DCA removal efficiency by 45.21% compared to the Blue TiO2-NTA alone, which is comparable to that of a microbial electrolysis cell. In the modified MPEC, the current efficiency reached 69.07% when the light intensity was 150 mW cm−2 and the 1,2-DCA concentration was 4.4 mM. The excellent performance of the novel MPEC was attributed to the efficient direct electron transfer process and the abundant dechlorinators and electroactive bacteria.

A hazardous waste landfill located in Turin, Italy was used as a case study. Ambient concentrations of 10 pollutants (BTEX, styrene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and 1,2-dichloropropane), measured in 10 points of the landfill area, were considered and analyzed.

PEG-εPL is produced by a fermentation process, and the crude product contains a significant amount of non-modified εPL, which is hardly separated by conventional chromatographic techniques. Both εPL species exist in fully protonated forms under certain acidic conditions, and an extractant, dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6), associates with their ammonium groups to stabilize the polycations in DCE. Despite the polydispersity of the samples, the εPL and crude PEG-εPL give well-defined cyclic voltammetric waves due to the DB18C6-assisted transfer of the polycations at the polarizable DB18C6 (DCE) | (W, pH ~ 3) interface with midpoint potentials useful for a rough prediction of ion partition equilibria. Thus, the partition experiment was performed using the DB18C6, Bu_4N[(CF_3SO_2)_2N] (DCE) | crude PEG-εPL, Li[(CF_3SO_2)_2N] (W, pH ~ 3) interfacial system, of which the potential difference was controlled to enable selective extraction of polycationic PEG-εPL by partition of the [(CF_3SO_2)_2N]^− ion. The extract could be collected from the DCE phase and was found to consist of highly purified PEG-εPL. Graphical abstract",

Lag times, steady-state fluxes and apparent permeability coefficients were obtained from the time courses of solvent appearance in the receptor medium, as measured by gas chromatography. The use of the same methodology and kind of skin resulted in small variability within experiments, underlining the need for consistent methodology for useful results for developing predictive models. Furthermore, a comparison of the neat and diluted data shows that water dilution affects all these variables and that the direction and magnitude of the effects vary between chemicals.

The interaction between Nb2O5 and TiO2 coupled with the molar ratio of Nb/Ti improved the physicochemical properties of Nb2O5-TiO2. Moreover, Nb2O5-TiO2 exhibited higher catalytic activity for DCE combustion than single Nb2O5 or TiO2. Especially, the 2Nb1Ti catalyst (Nb/Ti = 2:1, molar ratio) displayed the highest activity, over which 90% conversion of DCE could be achieved at 295 °C. These results were related to that the interaction effect between Nb2O5 and TiO2 improved acidity and oxidizing properties, and the materials had large surface area, all of which were favorable for adsorbing DCE at relatively low temperatures (below 93 °C) on Nb2O5-TiO2 and then improving catalytic combustion performance at lower reaction temperatures than Nb2O5 or TiO2.

The crystal structures of the haloalkane dehalogenase DhlA from the bacterium from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, specifically adapted for the conversion of the small 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) molecule, display the smallest catalytic site (110 Å3) within this enzyme family. However, during a substrate-specificity screening, we noted that DhlA can catalyze the conversion of far bulkier substrates, such as the 4-(bromomethyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-coumarin (220 Å3). This large substrate cannot bind to DhlA without conformational alterations. These conformational changes have been previously inferred from kinetic analysis, but their structural basis has not been understood. Using molecular dynamic simulations, we demonstrate here the intrinsic flexibility of part of the cap domain that allows DhlA to accommodate bulky substrates. The simulations displayed two routes for transport of substrates to the active site, one of which requires the conformational change and is likely the route for bulky substrates. These results provide insights into the structure–dynamics function relationships in enzymes with deeply buried active sites. Moreover, understanding the structural basis for the molecular adaptation of DhlA to 1,2-dichloroethane introduced into the biosphere during the industrial revolution provides a valuable lesson in enzyme design by nature.",

The objectives of this paper were to report the regulatory aspects and environmental monitoring management of toxic VOCs designated by Japan and Korea under the Air Pollution Control Act, and the Clean Air Conservation Act, respectively. It can be found that the environmental quality standards and environmental monitoring of priority VOCs (i.e., benzene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and dichloromethane) have been set and taken by the state and local governments of Japan since the early 2000, but not completely established in Korea. On the other hand, the significant progress in reducing the emissions of some toxic VOCs, including acrylonitrile, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, 1,2-dichloroethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene in Japan was also described as a case study in the brief report paper.",

A two-dimensional tank was filled with interbedded sandy-clayed sediments to simulate the field aquifer conditions. It is expected that the interbedded clayed sediments could supply bacteria for biological degradation and also supply Fe(II) for chemical oxidation in the presence of O2 due to hydroxyl radical (•OH) production. At a constant circulation flow rate of ∼3.5 PVs/day, 1,2-DCA at an initial concentration of ∼8.07 mg/L was degraded to ∼0.65 mg/L (91.9% removal) after 33-day treatment, in which 80–100 mA current was applied to the electrodes after the initial stage of 8-day circulation. Batch experiments proved that 1,2-DCA degradation was mainly attributed to aerobic biological oxidation, with likely contribution of anaerobic reductive dechlorination in certain areas. Chemical 1,2-DCA oxidation was negligible. This study suggests that coupling groundwater circulation and separated electrolysis is effective for stimulating biological 1,2-DCA degradation in heterogeneous aquifers.",

    "abstract": "Enhancements of the mixing ratios of short-lived halogenated gases were observed in air samples collected at Bachok Marine Research Station (BMRS), Peninsular Malaysia during Northern Hemisphere winters in 2013/2014 and 2015/2016. This study investigates the potential source regions and source types that influenced the variability in chlorinated very short-lived substances (Cl-VSLS) [dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloroethene] and methyl halides [methyl chloride and methyl bromide]. The UK Met Office’s Numerical Atmospheric Modelling Environment (NAME) dispersion model, was used for tracking the origin of air masses arriving at BMRS. For the purpose of identifying possible sources of these compounds, carbon monoxide (CO) emission data taken from the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 were used along with NAME footprints to calculate modelled CO mixing ratios. A correlation analysis between the mixing ratios of measured compounds and the modelled CO from various emission sectors was perform to assess the extent to which emission sectors might be related to the mixing ratios of halogenated gases. The results show that the events of higher mixing ratios were associated with air masses, especially from East China. During the 2013/2014 campaign, the modelled CO from industrial, solvents and agriculture (waste burning on fields) were significantly correlated with the mixing ratios of Cl-VSLS (R > 0.7) and methyl halides (R > 0.40). During the 2015/2016 campaign, the strength of these correlations reduced for Cl-VSLS (R > 0.5) and with no significant correlations for methyl halides. Instead, mixing ratios of methyl halides were correlated (R=0.4) with modelled CO from forest burning. This work provides evidence that East and South East Asia act as important sources of halogenated gases. This is of significant given the proximity of these regions to prevalent deep convection which can rapidly transport these halogencontaining gases into the stratosphere and impact the ozone layer.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, posing significant adverse impacts on air quality and human health. However, current research on atmospheric VOCs mainly focuses on specific regions or industries, without comprehensive national-level analysis. In this study, a total of 99 articles on atmospheric VOCs in China published from 2015 to 2024 were screened, and data on their concentrations, source apportionment, and health risks were extracted and summarized. The results revealed that the annual average concentrations of TVOCs and their groups in China generally increased and then decreased between 2011 and 2022, peaking in 2018–2019. A distinct seasonal pattern was observed, with the highest concentrations occurring in winter, followed by autumn, spring, and summer. TVOC emissions were highly concentrated in northern and eastern China, mainly contributed by alkanes and alkenes. Source apportionment of VOCs indicated that vehicle sources (32.9% ± 14.3%), industrial emissions (18.0% ± 12.8%), and other combustion sources (13.0% ± 13.0%) were the primary sources of VOCs in China. There was a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between the annual mean VOC concentration and population size, and a notable negative correlation (p < 0.05) with GDP per capita. Atmospheric VOCs had no non-carcinogenic risk (HI = 0.5) but exhibited a probable carcinogenic risk (7.5 × 10−5), with relatively high values for 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and naphthalene. The health risk was predominantly driven by halocarbons. These findings are essential for a better understanding of atmospheric VOCs and for developing more targeted VOC control measures.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "In recent years, the “coal to electricity” project (CTEP) using clean energy instead of coal for heating has been implemented by Beijing government to cope with air pollution. However, VOC pollution after CTEP was rarely studied in suburbs of Beijing. To fill this exigency, 116 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were observed during nonheating (P1) and heating (P2) periods in suburban Beijing. The results showed that the total of VOCs (TVOCs) was positively correlated with PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, and SO2 but negatively correlated with O3 and wind speed. The average TVOCs concentration was 19.43 ± 12.41 ppbv in P1 and 16.25 ± 8.01 ppbv in P2. Aromatics and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were the main contributors to ozone formation potential (OFP). Seven sources of VOCs identified by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model were industrial source, coal combustion, fuel evaporation, gasoline vehicle exhaust, diesel vehicle exhaust, background and biogenic sources, and solvent usage. The contribution of coal combustion to VOCs increased significantly during P2, whereas industrial sources, fuel evaporation, and solvent usage exhibited opposite trends. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) were used to analyze the source distributions. The results showed that VOC pollution was caused mainly by air mass from southern Hebei during P1 but by local emissions during P2. Therefore, although the contribution of coal combustion after heating increased, TVOCs concentration during P2 was lower than that during P1. Chronic noncarcinogenic risks of all selected VOC species were below the safe level, while the carcinogenic risks of most selected VOC species were above the acceptable risk level, especially for tetrachloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. The cancer risks posed by gasoline vehicle emissions, industrial enterprises, and coal combustion should be paid more attention.",

    "abstract": "We present an interacting quantum atoms (IQA) study of the gauche effect by comparing 1,2-difluoroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and three conformers of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane. In the 1,2-difluoroethane, the gauche effect is observed in that the gauche conformation is more stable than the anti, whereas in 1,2-dichloroethane the opposite is true. The analysis performed here is exhaustive and unbiased thanks to using the recently introduced relative energy gradient (REG) method [ Thacker , J. C. R. ; Popelier , P. L. A. Theor. Chem. Acc . 2017 , 136 , 86 ], as implemented in the in-house program ANANKE. We challenge the common explanation that hyperconjugation is responsible for the gauche stability in 1,2-difluoroethane and instead present electrostatics as the cause of gauche stability. Our explanation of the gauche effect is also is seen in other molecules displaying local gauche conformations, such as the recently synthesized \"all-cis\" hexafluorocyclohexane and its conformers where all the fluorine atoms are in the equatorial positions. Using our extension of the traditional IQA methodology that allows for the partitioning of electrostatic terms into polarization and charge transfer, we propose that the cause of gauche stability is 1,3 C···F electrostatic polarization interactions. In other words, if a number of fluorine atoms are aligned, then the stability due to polarization of nearby carbon atoms is increased.",

The SiIV corrole complexes exhibit sharp and blue‐shifted absorption spectra and larger fluorescence quantum yields as compared with the corresponding free‐base corroles. A μ‐oxo dimer of a SiIV corrole was synthesized upon treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in pyridine at 100 °C. This dimer shows a face‐to‐face structure with a 90° twist in the solid state. Although the dimer exhibits a blue‐shifted Soret band, reflecting the face‐to‐face geometry, it displays a largely red‐shifted and broad fluorescence spectrum with a large Stokes shift, suggesting a large structural change in the S1 state.

Melatonin, a prominent secretory product of the pineal gland, has been shown to offer protection against pyroptosis in male reproductive toxicity. However, the exact mechanism underlying 1,2-DCE-induced testicular toxicity and the comprehensive extent of melatonin's protective effects in this regard remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we sequenced testis piRNAs in mice exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of 1,2-DCE by 28-day dynamic inhalation, and investigated the role of key piRNAs using GC-2 spd cells. Our results showed that 1,2-DCE induced mouse testicular damage and GC-2 spd cell pyroptosis. 1,2-DCE upregulated the expression of pyroptosis-correlated proteins in both mouse testes and GC-2 spd cells. 1,2-DCE exposure caused pore formation on cellular membranes and lactate dehydrogenase leakage in GC-2 spd cells. Additionally, we identified three upregulated piRNAs in 1,2-DCE-exposed mouse testes, among which piR-mmu-1019957 induced pyroptosis in GC-2 spd cells, and its inhibition alleviated 1,2-DCE-induced pyroptosis. PiR-mmu-1019957 mimic and 1,2-DCE treatment activated the expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) in GC-2 spd cells. IRF7 knockdown reversed 1,2-DCE-induced cellular pyroptosis, and overexpression of piR-mmu-1019957 did not promote pyroptosis when IRF7 was inhibited. Notably, melatonin reversed 1,2-DCE-caused testicular toxicity, cellular pyroptosis, and upregulated piR-mmu-1019957 and IRF7. Collectively, our findings indicated that melatonin mitigates this effect, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic intervention against 1,2-DCE-induced male reproductive toxicity in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "We have attempted to detect electrically neutral substances by ion-transfer voltammetry at an interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES), such as an interface between water and 1,2-dichloroethane (a W/DCE interface), by irradiating the interface with ultraviolet light (200–300 nm). In the present work, while considering the facts that p-phenylenediamine derivatives are soluble in DCE, but insoluble in water, and that cation radicals of the derivatives are fairly stable in various media, we photoionized the derivatives in a DCE phase by ultraviolet irradiation, and after that carried out ion-transfer voltammetry at a W/DCE interface. As a result, we could successfully observe ion-transfer waves of cation radicals of the derivatives from the W to DCE phase. Namely, the cation radicals are generated in the DCE phase by ultraviolet irradiation, and subsequently distributed into the W phase. In addition to these ion-transfer waves, we also found that facilitated proton-transfer waves by the derivatives were shifted to a more negative potential region after ultraviolet irradiation, because of hydrogen chloride formed from photodecomposition of DCE by ultraviolet irradiation.",

Indoor simulation experiments based on SVE were conducted to provide technical guidance for the remediation of 1,2-DCA-contaminated soil, with the overall intention of soil repair and ecological restoration. A thermal oxidation SVE (TOSVE) system was designed on the basis of SVE technology for application in the remediation of low-permeability soil contaminated with halogenated hydrocarbons from a chemical plant in Northeast China. Laboratory simulation experiments were conducted based on TOSVE technology to study the removal of target pollutants under different organic contents, moisture and air speeds. For the first time, a new material, scoria, was added to the oxidant at different proportions, and its effect on the exhaust gas treatment efficiency was examined. Thermal extraction improved the extraction efficiency of pollutants from low-permeability soil. Moreover, the adsorption–oxidation effect of 0.1–0.25 mm scoria prepared by 20% Na2S2O8 on 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) in tail gas was higher than that of the oxidant without scoria, indicating that scoria is effective in tail gas treatment.",

Proton transfer from the acidic aqueous phase to the DCE phase is ensured by negative chemical polarization of the liquid|liquid interface. The reduction of protons in DCE occurs only after excitation of DMRc by light. Voltammetry performed with the organic droplet-modified glassy carbon electrode immersed in the aqueous electrolyte solution of various anions, indicated that oxidation of DMRc is followed by an anion insertion from water into the organic phase. We demonstrate that DMRc can be electrochemically regenerated at the microelectrode positioned close to the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) by the scanning electrochemical microscopy.

Transfer of the classical hydronium ion across the water/1,2-dichloroethan interface involves the co-transfer of three hydration shell water molecules independent of the surface tension. However, as the interaction between the two liquids weakens, rise in interfacial tension and decrease in intrinsic water fingering and capillary fluctuations results in fewer water molecules co-transported with the ion in the second shell and a reduction in the length of the finger that the ion is attached to, consistent with the reduced size of the second hydration shell. First shell water residence time and lateral ion diffusion constants varies with the surface tension in a way that are consistent with the above structural insight.",

In recent years, due to the stricter requirements for compliance with the provisions of the Rotterdam Convention, the volume of export notifications on the permission to import dangerous chemicals into the Russian Federation has increased significantly. Therefore, the purpose of our research was to analyze the nomenclature, volume, toxicity and danger of industrial chemicals and pesticides entering the Russian market, despite prohibitions or restrictions on their use at the international and national levels. Materials and methods. The materials used are applications for the import of chemical products (export notifications) of the National Designated authorities of the European Union, China, Great Britain, Serbia to the Russian Register of Potentially Dangerous Chemical and Biological Substances-a branch of the Federal State Scientific Research Center named after F.F. Erisman - in the period from 2018 to 2020. The year 2019 was considered in the most detail. Results and discussion. The analysis of applications showed an ever-increasing number of chemical supplies; for example, 130 notifications were received in 2018, 539 in 2019, and 565 in 2020. In 2019, the number of tin compounds prevailed in the nomenclature of imported products to the territory of the Russian Federation. As for the substances from Annex III of the Rotterdam Convention, most of the imported chemicals by tonnage were substances included in this document - 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB), carbofuran, ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride (1,2-dichloroethane), which are imported for industrial use, and not for use as pesticides, as they are declared in the convention. Chemicals and pesticides imported into the country under the PIC procedure, with the exception of numerous derivatives of dibutyl - and dioctyltin, creosote, have an established hygienic standard in at least one human habitat. In most cases, they are assigned to hazard classes 1 and 2 according to the maximum permissible concentration. Conclusion. Chemical products that are highly dangerous for human health and the environment, which are banned or severely restricted in many states, caused specific and long-term effects on the body, and having high toxicity to natural biota are used in the Russian Federation economy. In this regard, there is a need to develop regulatory decisions at the national level and within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the prohibition or restriction of the circulation of substances and pesticides characterized by an unacceptable risk of exposure.",

Xerogels A, B, C, and D were prepared by removing the solvent form Gels A, B, C, and D, respectively. X-ray diffractometry analysis showed that sharper diffraction peaks were observed for Xerogels A, C, and D compared to their corresponding powder states, and a new peak was identified on the small angle region, suggesting the formation of lamellar structures. The wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements of Xerogels C and D exhibited the primary peaks as well as the secondary to quaternary peaks, confirming the formation of stacking-layer structures.

    "abstract": "Since the grain boundaries (GBs) within the semiconductor layer of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have a strong influence on device performance, a substantial number of studies have been devoted to controlling the crystallization characteristics of organic semiconductors. We studied the intrinsic effects of GBs within 5,11-bis(triethylsilylethynyl) anthradithiophene (TES-ADT) thin films on the electrical properties of OFETs. The GB density was easily changed by controlling nulceation event in TES-ADT thin films. When the mixing time was increased, the number of aggregates in as-spun TES-ADT thin films were increased and subsequent exposure of the films to 1,2-dichloroethane vapor led to a significant increase in the number of nuleation sites, thereby increasing the GB density of TES-ADT spherulites. The density of GBs strongly influences the angular spread and crystallographic orientation of TES-ADT spherulites. Accordingly, the FETs with higher GB densities showed much poorer electrical characteristics than devices with lower GB density. Especially, GBs provide charge trapping sites which are responsible for bias-stress driven electrical instability. Dielectric surface treatment with a polystyrene brush layer clarified the GB-induced charge trapping by reducing charge trapping at the semiconductor-dielectric interface. Our study provides an understanding on GB induced bias instability for the development of high performance OFETs.",

Recently developed luminescent azahelicenes of furoquinoline series demonstrate strong acidochromic effect both on absorption and emission spectra. One of the features of these compounds is the photochemical formation of a protonated form in chlorine-containing solvents under UV irradiation.

HRB were screened and isolated from 7 enrichment cultures (ES1-ES7), from DCA-contaminated soils, on bicarbonate-buffered basal salts medium containing 10 mM acetate and 250 µM DCA under anaerobic conditions and analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that the mixed cultures of ES3 and ES5 could reductively dechlorinate DCA to ethylene via a direct reductive dihaloelimination pathway. In particular, ES5 showed rapid transformation of 250 µM DCA to ethylene within 6 days at 30 °C. Specific microbial populations of Vulcanibacillus spp., elucidated by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, were found only in ES3 and ES5, which was related to reductive dihaloelimination activities on DCA.

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "We have previously reported that the activation of astrocytes and microglia may lead to the overproduction of proinflammatory mediators, which could induce neuroinflammation and cause brain edema in 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE)-intoxicated mice. In this research, we further hypothesized that astrocyte–microglia crosstalk might trigger neuroinflammation and contribute to brain edema in 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice. The present research revealed, for the first time, that subacute intoxication with 1,2-DCE might provoke the proinflammatory polarization of microglia, and pretreatment with minocycline, a specific inhibitor of microglial activation, may attenuate the enhanced protein levels of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule1 (Iba-1), cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), soluble calcium-binding protein 100B (S100B), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, and p-p65, and ameliorate the suppressed protein expression levels of occludin and claudin 5; we also observed changes in water content and made pathological observations on edema in the brains of 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice. Moreover, pretreatment with fluorocitrate, an inhibitor of reactive astrocytes, could also reverse the alteration in protein expression levels of GFAP, S100B, Iba-1, CD11b, TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, MMP-9, occludin, and claudin 5 in the brain of 1,2-DCE intoxicated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory drug, could also attenuate the above-mentioned changes in the brains of 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice. Altogether, the findings from this research indicated that microglial activation might play an important role in triggering neuroinflammation, and hence may contribute to brain edema formation; additionally, the findings suggested that molecular crosstalk between reactive astrocytes and activated microglia may amplify the neuroinflammatory reaction, which could induce secondary brain injury in 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "\n Background1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) is a synthetic organic chemical that causes brain edema under subacute poisoning. Our previous studies indicated that the neuroinflammation could be induced due to activation of both astrocytes and microglia during the course of brain edema in 1,2-DCE intoxicated mice. However, the crosstalk between the two glial cells in 1,2-DCE-induced neuroinflammation is unclear. In the current studies, we hypothesized that astrocytes are the first responder to the effects of 1,2-DCE in the brain, as they adhere to the cerebral capillaries, and they are an essential component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).MethodsWe used primary cultured rat astrocytes and microglia, as well as a highly aggressively proliferating immortalized (HAPI) microglia cell line to study the effects of astrocytes on microglia polarization following exposure to 2-CE. ResultsFindings from the present studies demonstrated that treatment of primary rat astrocytes with 2-chloroethanol (2-CE), the intermediate metabolite of 1,2-DCE in vivo, can stimulate the activation of A1 reactive astrocytes (A1s) through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/ nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathways by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during 2-CE metabolism. A1s activated by 2-CE can upregulate the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and stimulate the M1 polarization of microglia through IL-1β and TNF-α released by 2-CE activated A1s. Microglia are less sensitive to 2-CE than astrocytes, since treatment of primary rat microglia with 30 mM 2-CE alone failed to activate them, though this dose of 2-CE can activate A1s and in turn stimulate M1 polarization of microglia through the factors released by A1s. ConclusionThe neuroinflammation induced by 1,2-DCE in the brain of mice is most probably triggered by the activation of astrocytes. The understanding of the multidimensional roles of reactive astrocytes may further the development of new treatment strategies in reducing neuroinflammation and brain edema following 1,2-DCE-induced toxic encephalopathy.",

Using polarizable forcefields fit to ab initio quantum chemistry calculations, we have computed the absolute oxidation potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple in water, acetonitrile, 1,2-dichloroethane, and trichloromethane.

In this work, LaSrMnCoO6 (LSMC) double perovskite-type materials with high thermal stability and coke resistance in 1,2-DCE oxidation were prepared by a facile sol-gel method. Based on this, a series of CrOx/LaSrMnCoO6 catalysts (Cr/LSMC, CrOx loading = 5 to 20 wt.%) which combine the merits of CrOx (high activity and chlorine tolerance) and LaSrMnCoO6 were synthesized and adopted in deep oxidation of 1,2-DCE for the first time. As expected, obvious synergistic effects between CrOx and LSMC on 1,2-DCE destruction were observed. Amongst, 10 wt.% CrOx/LaSrMnCoO6 (10Cr/LSMC) shows the best catalytic activity with 90% of 1,2-DCE destructed at 400 °C. Furthermore, the outstanding catalytic durability and water resistance of 10Cr/LSMC in 1,2-DCE oxidation were also demonstrated. In addition to this, the reaction pathway of 1,2-DCE decomposition over Cr/LSMC materials was discussed based on the results of online product analysis. We found that the enhanced catalytic performance of Cr/LSMC materials can be reasonably attributed to their high reducibility, excellent 1,2-DCE adsorption capability, and large amounts of surface active lattice oxygen species. It can be anticipated that the Cr/LSMC catalysts are promising materials for CVOC elimination and the results from this work could also provide some new insights into the design of catalysts for CVOC efficient destruction.",

    "abstract": "Coupled electron- and phase-transfer reactions are fundamentally important in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, e.g., intercalation of Li+ in batteries, and electrochemistry at the triple-phase boundary in fuel cells. The mechanism, energetics and kinetics of these complex reactions play an important role in device performance. Herein, we describe experimental methodology to quantitatively investigate coupled electron- and phase-transfer reactions at an individual, geometrically well-defined, three-phase interface. Specifically, a Pt-Ir wire electrode is placed across a H2O/1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) interface, creating a Pt Ir/H2O/DCE boundary that is defined mathematically by a line around the surface of the wire. We investigated the oxidation of ferrocene (Fc) initially present in DCE (but essentially insoluble in water) at the 3-phase boundary, and the transfer of its charged reaction product ferrocenium (Fc+) across the interface into the aqueous phase. In cyclic voltammetry, a reversible wave at E1/2 ~ 0.55 V is observed for Fc oxidation in DCE on the first scan. The Fc+ produced near the H2O/DCE interface transfers into the aqueous phase. On the second and subsequent cycles, a second reversible wave at more negative potentials, E1/2 ~ 0.32 V, is observed, corresponding to the reduction of Fc+ (and re-oxidation back to Fc) in the aqueous phase. Finite-element simulations quantitatively capture the voltammetric response of coupled electron- and phase-transfer at the three-phase interface, and indicate that the electrochemical response observed in the aqueous phase occurs within ~200 μm of the Pt-Ir/H2O/DCE boundary. Finally, we demonstrate that the rate of transfer of Fc+ is strongly dependent on the concentration of supporting electrolyte, reaching a maximum at intermediate electrolyte concentration, suggesting a critical role of the electric field distribution in determining the reaction rates at the three phase interface.",

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed to evaluate the possibility of ϵ‐CL‐20 phase transformation induced by organic solvent molecules from the perspective of ϵ‐CL‐20 electronic structure and molecular structure variations. Additionally, experimental study of ϵ‐CL‐20 phase transformation induced by 1,2‐dichloroethane, ethanol, and methanol gas environment was conducted.

Moreover, the existence of 1,2-DCA can do harm to human organs. Hence, it is urgent to develop an effective technology for the remediation of 1,2-DCA-contaminated groundwater. In this study, the calcium peroxide (CaO2) system activated by Fe(III) was applied to the degradation of 1,2-DCA and 83.3% of 1,2-DCA could be effectively removed within 3 h when the molar ratio of CaO2/Fe(III)/1,2-DCA was 30/120/1. The results of probe experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) detection, and scavenging tests demonstrated that both HO• and O2−• were the key factors for 1,2-DCA degradation. The released amount of Cl− (84.1%) revealed that most of the chlorine in 1,2-DCA could be dechlorinated. GC-MS was applied for the detection of intermediates during 1,2-DCA degradation and the possible degradation pathway was proposed that 1,2-DCA was first reduced to vinyl chloride (VC) and then oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Finally, 73.4% removal of 1,2-DCA could be achieved in the actual groundwater when the molar ratio of CaO2/Fe(III)/1,2-DCA was 100/400/1, demonstrating that CaO2/Fe(III) system has a remarkable prospective in 1,2-DCA-contaminated groundwater remediation.",

While nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) is considered an effective reductant for removing a wide range of chlorinated hydrocarbons, 1,2-DCA is resistant to reduction by NZVI as well as by modified forms of NZVI (e.g., sulfidated-NZVI). Hydroxyl radicals produced in Fenton's reaction can effectively degrade 1,2-DCA, but Fenton's reaction requires the acidification of saturated zones to achieve a groundwater pH of 3 to facilitate the catalytic reaction. To overcome this problem, this study has developed a sequential treatment process using an NZVI-induced Fenton-like reaction that can effectively degrade 1,2-DCA at an initially neutral pH range. The experiments were conducted using a high 1,2-DCA concentration (2000 mg/L) to evaluate the feasibility of using the treatment process at source zones. The process degraded 99% of 1,2-DCA with a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.49 h-1. Unlike the single-stage treatment process, the sequential treatment can control the used H2O2 concentration in the system, thus sustaining the reaction and resulting in more efficient 1,2-DCA degradation. To mimic subsurface conditions, batch experiments were conducted to remove 1,2-DCA sorbed in contaminated soil. The results show that 99% removal of 1,2-DCA was obtained within 16 h.

This substance is used in industry as an intermediate in the production of vinyl chloride, but it is also used in the production of other chlorinated hydrocarbons.

The aim of this study was to develop a method for determining concentrations of 1,2-dichloroethane in the workplace air in the range from 1/10 to 2 MAC values (0.82–16.4 mg/m3). The study was performed using a gas chromatograph (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID) equipped with a capillary column HP-1 (50 m x 0.32 mm; 0.3 μm). The method is based on the adsorption of 1,2-dichloroethane on activated charcoal, desorption of analyzed compound with carbon disulfide and analysis of obtained solution with GC-FID. The use of HP-1 column enabled selective determination of 1,2-dichloroethane in a presence of other substances. The average desorption coefficient of 1,2-dichloroethane from charcoal was 0.98. The method is linear (r = 0.9999) within the investigated working range from 9.84 to 196.8 μg/ml, which is equivalent to air concentrations from 0.82 to 16.4 mg/m3 for a 12-L air sample. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were to 2.284 μg/ml and 6.85 μg/ml, respectively. The analytical method described in this paper enables selective determination of 1,2-dichloroethane in workplace air in presence of other substances at concentrations from 0.82 mg/m3 (1/10 MAC value). The method is precise, accurate and it meets the criteria for procedures for measuring chemical agents listed in Standard No. EN 482.

    "abstract": "Ferrocene is commonly used as an internal redox couple in electrochemical measurements. Therefore, understanding how the absolute oxidation potential of ferrocene is modulated by different solvents and ion concentrations is important for the comparison of experimental measurements between different electrochemical systems. While standard implicit solvation models may provide relatively good predictions in bulk solvents, they lack the ability to describe ion coordination effects that can substantially alter redox potentials in practical electrolyte systems. In this work, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to compute absolute oxidation potentials for the ferrocene and decamethylferrocene redox couple in bulk solvents of water, acetonitrile, 1,2-dichloroethane, and trichloromethane, as well as organic electrolytes consisting of mixtures of [BMIM+][BF4–] ionic liquid and acetonitrile and 1,2-dichloroethane solvents, for a wide range of ion concentrations. The goals are twofold: first, for the bulk solvents, we compare and evaluate the consistency of redox potential predictions for polarizable and nonpolarizable force fields from explicit solvent, free energy simulations, with predictions from an implicit solvent model. Second, we evaluate how ion coordination within the organic electrolytes modulates the redox potential of ferrocene and decamethylferrocene as a function of the ionic concentration and solvent dielectric constant. Utilizing linear response theory, we analyze the solvation contribution to the redox potential in terms of distributions of anion coordination number and how the anion coordination modulates the vertical ionization energy. We show that inclusion of liquid-vacuum interfacial potentials is essential for consistent prediction/interpretation of redox potentials across different solvents and force fields in order to compensate for the artificial quadrupole trace contribution to the solute cavity interfacial potential; this important consideration was previously proposed by Harder and Roux [J.

In this study, bamboo charcoal (BC) was used as an improver to modify polyurethane (PU) foam. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that the addition of BC could effectively improve the mechanical properties of PU. The adsorption data exhibited that the BC-loaded PU (BC/PU) foam composites effectively removed seven organic solvents (OSs, including octane, petroleum ether, soybean oil, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, n-hexane, cyclohexane), and the maximum adsorption capacity of BC/PU was 23.6 g g −1 when BC content was 5%. The order of pseudo-second-order kinetic constants and maximum adsorption capacity of seven OSs was octane < petroleum ether < soybean oil < chlorobenzene < 1, 2-dichloroethane < cyclohexane <  n -hexane. Based on the experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) simulation, the adsorption mechanism of OSs on BC/PU-5 was discussed. The E HOMO and μ of OSs calculated by DFT were highly correlated with absorption affinity (K 2 , Q e and Q max ). Hence, the contribution of OSs to the adsorption efficiency of BC/PU-5 may be mainly due to electron donor–acceptor (EDA) interaction and non-hydrophobic interaction. In addition, the adsorption capacity did not change significantly after repeated recycling 5 times. Overall, the prepared BC/PU foam composites could be used as a potential candidate for separating OSs in engineering applications. Graphical Abstract 1.

Firstly, a novel bifunctional ATRP initiator, 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene-thioethane-2,1-diyl)bis(2-bromo-2-methylpropanoat) (PXTBR), synthesized the reaction of p-xylene-bis(1-hydroxy-3-thia-propane) (PXTOH) with α-bromoisobutryl bromide.

Secondly, di(α-bromoester) end-functionalized PCL–based ATRP macronitiator (PXTPCLBr) was prepared by esterification of hydroxyl end groups of PCL-diol (PXTPCLOH) synthesized by Sn(Oct)2–catalyzed ring opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-CL in bulk using (PXTOH) as initiator.

In addition, the extraction abilities of PCL and PS were investigated under liquid–liquid phase conditions using heavy metal picrates (Ag+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+) as substrates and measuring with UV-Vis the amounts of picrate in the 1,2–dichloroethane phase before and after treatment with the polymers. The extraction affinity of PXTPCL and PXTPS for Hg2+ was found to be highest in the liquid–liquid phase extraction experiments.

Results of present study disclosed that Ca2+-ATPase activities in group B and C, and Na+/K+-ATPase activity in group C decreased, whereas intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations in group B and C increased significantly compared with control. Moreover, ATP content decreased, whereas lactic acid content increased significantly in group C compared with control.

The use of traditional methods of water disinfection with active chlorine aggravates\nthe situation and leads to formation of highly toxic organochlorine compounds. In this regard, one of the urgent\nhygienic problems is to establish health effect of these toxicants in the population including its most sensitive groups.\nThe objective of the study was to establish and quantify the relationship between concentrations of chloroform and its\nderivatives in drinking water and blood levels of organochlorine compounds in children consuming potable water with\na higher content of chlorine and its derivatives. Materials and methods: The study was conducted on six territories of\nthe Perm Region constituting an observation area where drinking water was noncompliant with hygienic standards\nby a number of indices, and a comparison area. The analysis of trihalomethanes in drinking water samples was carried\nout in accordance with the requirements of sanitary regulations SanPiN 2.1.4.1074–01. The levels of trihalomethanes\n(chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dibromochloromethane, dichlorobromethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane) in children’s\nblood samples were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography in combination with a specific detector to increase\nselectivity and sensitivity of determination. We used a Kristall-5000 gas chromatograph with an Optima-5 capillary\ncolumn (25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μL) and a selective electron capture detector (ECD). Results: The data of comprehensive\nchemical analyses of average levels of trihalomethanes in blood samples of children consuming drinking water with\nan increased content of determined compounds (up to 3.5 MPC) and the water complying with hygienic standards are\npresented. We observed significant differences (р<0.005) between two groups in the blood levels of chloroform, carbon\ntetrachloride, and 1,2-dichloroethane that were 5.6, 6 and 24 times higher in children of the test group compared to\nthe controls. Conclusion: We revealed a statistically significant causal relationship between the increase in chloroform\nconcentrations in drinking water and the increase in blood levels of chloroform in children described by the equation\nу=0.00188+0.01782х (R2=0.263, p=0.0018).",

Quite unprecedented, careful adjustment of the stoichiometry of reagents allowed the selective crystallization of the Lewis adducts containing one, two, or three Te-bonded OPR3, according to X-ray diffraction. 1H and 19F Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy-monitored titrations of the telluronium salt by OPPh3 reveal the growth of the hydrodynamic volume of the various cationic adducts, alongside a unique behavior of the BArF- counterion that suggests its aggregation at high cationic molecular sizes. Isotherm titration calorimetry experiments show that the association equilibrium constants of OPR3 binding to Te σ-holes follow the order Ka1 > Ka2 > Ka3, with respective values decreasing by 1 up to 2 orders of magnitude as the σ-holes are populated. Analysis of Te-O bonding by DFT methods confirms their dominant Coulombic character. The minor covalent character is nonetheless required to ensure telluronium-ligand cohesion.

Both sorption-desorption cycle at a constant temperature and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of the residual solvent manifest themselves as a change of the film thickness. Monitoring of ellipsometric angles of the coating allows us to determine the thickness as a function of the vapor pressure or sample temperature. The solvent vapor pressure is precisely regulated by a computer-controlled pneumatics. TPD spectra are recorded during heating of the film in an oil-free vacuum. The vapor pressure control system is described in detail. The system has been tested on 6-170 nm thick polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(2-vinyl pyridine) films deposited on silicon substrates. Liquid toluene, water, ethanol, isopropanol, cyclohexane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and chlorobenzene were used to create a vapor atmosphere. Typical sorption-desorption and TPD curves are shown. The instrument achieves sub-monolayer sensitivity for adsorption studies on flat surfaces. Polymer-solvent vapor systems with strong interaction demonstrate characteristic absorption-desorption hysteresis spanning from vacuum to the glass transition pressure. Features on the TPD curves can be classified as either glass transition related film contraction or low temperature broad contraction peak. Typical absorption-desorption and TPD dependencies recorded for the 6 nm thick polystyrene film demonstrate the possibility to apply the presented technique for probing size effects in extremely thin coatings.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "High-performance quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) require balanced electron and hole injection into the QD emissive layer—an especially difficult task when using all-solution processes. One effective strategy for achieving this balance is to create a stepwise hole injection pathway via double-hole transport layers (D-HTLs). Poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine))] (TFB) are commonly employed in D-HTLs because of their favorable energy level alignment and suitable hole mobilities. However, constructing TFB/PVK D-HTLs demands careful attention to solvent orthogonality, as both polymers often dissolve in the same solvent. Thus, identifying a solvent system that enables the formation of TFB/PVK D-HTLs without damaging the TFB layer is crucial. In this study, we systematically investigate the solvent orthogonality of TFB/PVK and demonstrate high-performance QD-LEDs fabricated entirely by solution processes. We examine various PVK solvents—evaluating their polarity, solubility, and potential to damage the TFB layer—and identify 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) as optimal for forming TFB/PVK D-HTLs with minimal damage. The resulting all-solution-processed QD-LEDs exhibit a 1.5-fold increase in external quantum efficiency compared to devices employing a single HTL. Furthermore, 1,2-DCE also proves effective in inverted QD-LED architectures, protecting the QD emissive layer during PVK deposition and demonstrating its versatility across multiple device architectures.",

The success of this three‐component reaction is attributed to the in situ generation of an active 1‐(2‐chloroethyl)‐1,4‐diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan‐1‐ium (DABCO·DCE) salt, which judiciously acts as a formal N‐(2‐chloroethyl)piperazine equivalent in the defluorinative coupling with less‐studied aliphatic fluorinated substances. Impressively, this reaction accomplishes multi‐activation of robust C(sp3)‐F, C(sp3)‐Cl, C(sp3)‐O, and C(sp3)‐N bonds in a one‐pot process, offering a practical platform for the late‐stage functionalization of complex molecules. Furthermore, the resulting products can not only serve as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of fluorinated heterocycles, but also undergo C—Cl bond displacement transformations with N‐, O‐, and S‐nucleophiles.\n",

    "abstract": "To enhance the reductive dechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) in groundwater, substrate injection may be required. However, substrate biodegradation causes groundwater acidification and sulfide production, which inhibits the bacteria responsible for DCA dechlorination and results in an odor problem. In the microcosm study, the effectiveness of the addition of ferrous sulfate (FS), desulfurization slag (DS), and nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) on acidification and sulfide control was studied during reductive dechlorination of DCA, and the emulsified substrate (ES) was used as the substrate. Up to 94% of the sulfide was removed with FS and DS addition (0.25 wt%) (initial DCA concentration = 13.5 mg/L). FS and DS amendments resulted in the formation of a metal sulfide, which reduced the hydrogen sulfide concentration as well as the subsequent odor problem. Approximately 96% of the DCA was degraded under reductive dechlorination with nZVI or DS addition using ES as the substrate. In microcosms with nZVI or DS addition, the sulfide concentration was reduced to less than 15 μg/L. Acidification can be controlled via hydroxide ions production after nZVI oxidation and reaction of free CaO (released from DS) with water, which enhanced DCA dechlorination. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction results confirmed that the microcosms with nZVI added had the highest Dehalococcoides population (up to 2.5 × 108 gene copies/g soil) due to effective acidification control. The α-elimination mechanism was the main abiotic process, and reductive dechlorination dominated by Dehalococcides was the biotic mechanism that resulted in DCA removal. More than 22 bacterial species were detected, and dechlorinating bacteria existed in soils under alkaline and acidic conditions.",

Both spot (or grab) and time weighted average (TWA) sampling methods were assessed over the same two day sampling time period. For spot sampling, replicate samples were taken at each site and analyzed within 12 h of sampling by both Headspace (HS)- and direct (DI)- solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling/extraction methods followed by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). For TWA, a two day passive on-site TWA sampling was carried out at the same sampling points in the ponds. All SPME sampling methods undertaken used a 65-µm PDMS/DVB SPME fiber, which was found optimal for THM sampling. Sampling conditions were optimized in the laboratory using calibration standards of chloroform, bromoform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,2-dichloroethane, prepared in aqueous solutions from analytical grade samples. Calibration curves for all methods with R2 values ranging from 0.985–0.998 (N = 5) over the quantitation linear range of 3–800 ppb were achieved. The different sampling methods were compared for quantification of the water samples, and results showed that DI- and TWA- sampling methods gave better data and analytical metrics. Addition of 10% wt./vol. of (NH4)2SO4 salt to the sampling vial was found to aid extraction of THMs by increasing GC peaks areas by about 10%, which resulted in lower detection limits for all techniques studied. However, for on-site TWA analysis of THMs in natural waters, the calibration standard(s) ionic strength conditions, must be carefully matched to natural water conditions to properly quantitate THM concentrations.

The mechanisms underlying 1,2-DCE-induced hepatotoxicity are not fully understood. Numerous studies have demonstrated that long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a pivotal role in the chemical-induced toxicity. To explore whether aberrant lncRNA expression is involved in hepatotoxicity mediated by 1,2-DCE exposure, we detected alterations of lncRNA expression profiling in a mouse model of 1,2-DCE-induced hepatotoxicity by microarray chip. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that a down-regulated lncRNA (lncRNA241) after 1,2-DCE exposure might be involved in 1,2-DCE-induced hepatotoxicity. We treated AML12 cells with 1,2-DCE and its metabolite 2-chloroacetic acid (2-CA) for 48 h, and the results revealed that it was 2-CA rather than primary form (1,2-DCE) that resulted in the decline of lncRNA241 expression in hepatocytes. In vitro intervention studies revealed that the repression of lncRNA241 expression after 2-CA exposure led to the down-regulation of anti-apoptosis-associated factor insulin growth factor-1 (Igf1) at mRNA and protein levels through modulation of their common target mmu-miR-451a, which promoted hepatic apoptosis. This study provides valuable insight into the role of lncRNAs in response to hepatocyte apoptosis induced by 1,2-DCE.",

The formation of bimetallic AgPd structures is most effective for AgPd/TiO2, followed by AgPd/C and then AgPd/SiO2 catalysts. FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO suggest that Pd is well dispersed on the Ag nanoparticles for the TiO2-supported catalyst, while more contiguous Pd sites are present on the SiO2-supported catalyst. Ethylene selectivities of up to 97% and 82% are achieved on AgPd/TiO2 and AgPd/C catalysts, respectively. The AgPd/SiO2 catalyst is 91% selective to ethane.

However, conventional in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) methods are constrained by inefficient mass transfer, leading to suboptimal remediation outcomes. This study developed a pump-and-treat enhanced in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO-P) system employing sodium persulphate (activated by sodium hydroxide). Considering the two-phase partitioning characteristics of 1,2-DCA, we proposed a rapid estimation method for remediation agent dosage grounded in the Freundlich isotherm model. Laboratory-scale simulations demonstrated that hydrodynamic regulation optimizes density-driven contaminant transport dynamics in heterogeneous aquifers. This enhancement coupling reduced the remediation duration from molecular diffusion-dominated processes (traditional ISCO) to 6 days, while expanding effective treatment zones by eightfold. Field applications confirmed the efficacy of the technology: optimised well configurations achieved 20–30 m remediation agent diffusion radii, with 95.7 % reduction in 1,2-DCA concentration within 7 months and sustained stabilisation below 147 μg/L. Byproduct risks (e.g., sulphate levels and pH fluctuations) remained controlled for over 31-month operational period.

Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the most prevalent water channel in the brain, and the pool of AQP4 facilitates brain edema by controlling the inflow and clearance of brain water. MicroRNAs play an important role in the regulation of brain edema via RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. To explore the regulation role of AQP4 and microRNA in 1,2-DCE-induced brain edema, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and AQP4 knockout CD-1 mice were exposed to 1,2-DCE by inhalation for 7 days (0, 600, 1,800 mg/m3) and 28 days (0, 100, 350, 700 mg/m3), respectively. The results showed that 1,2-DCE induces brain edema, in both rats and mice, characterized by an increase in brain water content and vacuolations in the brain parenchyma and around the vessels of the cerebral cortex. Notably, 1,2-DCE exposure can down-regulate AQP4 expression, in both rats and mice. Also, deleting AQP4 intensifies 1,2-DCE-induced brain edema in mice. Meanwhile, microRNA-29b-3p (miR-29b) expression increases with 1,2-DCE exposure, in both rats and mice. A negative correlation was found between the expression of miR-29b and AQP4 in vivo. Moreover, the negative regulation of miR-29b by direct targeting to AQP4 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay in vitro. Taken together, our findings indicate that AQP4 plays an important role in balancing water content in 1,2-DCE-induced brain edema. The dysregulation of miR-29b after 1,2-DCE exposure can aggravate brain edema by directly suppressing the expression of AQP4.",

However, the high viscosity of typical DESs can decrease the mass transfer rate and increase energy consumption for pumping, thereby limiting their overall efficiency and feasibility in industrial applications. In this work, the efficient absorption of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) was intensified by designing a series of low-viscosity DESs, and the absorption performance, separation mechanism, and conceptual industrial process simulation were systematically investigated. The results showed that 3,4-DMOET:ButA with molar ratio of 1:2 was chosen as the suitable absorbent for DCE due to its maximum saturated absorption capacity (2746 mg/g at 20 °C, atmospheric pressure, and saturated content of DCE in the feed gas) and minimum viscosity property (26.51 mPa·s at 20 °C). The absorption mechanism was investigated by 1H NMR, FT-IR and quantum chemical (QC) calculations, indicating that the absorption was a physical process. The weak interaction analysis results illustrated that both HBD and HBA play an important role in the separation. Specifically, C–H···π and C–H···Cl are the main contributors to the HBA–DCE interaction, while C–H···O HB and vdW interactions played a dominant role in the HBD–DCE interaction.

Initially, the selectivity of the XSD, reactor temperature, and response to Cl standards were assessed. The method was then applied to the distilled fractions of a PPO. Using GC × GC-HR-TOFMS, several organochlorides were identified, including 1-chlorobutane, which was found at the highest concentration in the first distilled fraction (50-100 °C), and 3-(chloromethyl)heptane and 1,3-dichlorobezene, which were eluted primarily in the third fraction (150-200 °C). Other compounds, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, and 2-chloroethyl benzoate, were also detected at lower concentrations. The GC-XSD was proved to exhibit robust and selective capability for organochloride speciation in PPOs and could be potentially implemented in quality control and routine laboratories. When combined with hyphenated techniques such as GC × GC-HR-TOFMS, GC-XSD also facilitates the identification of unknown organochlorides.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Air contamination by 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) is recognized as a threat across countries. Addressing this problem is challenging due to the absence of clearly defined biological standards for monitoring 1,2-DCE exposure among humans. Moreover, studies on the impacts of 1,2-DCE exposure on human health are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the level of 1,2-DCE in urine—separated into the health behavior and occupation groups—as well as its effects on blood biochemicals among overall 200 outdoor workers, with 50 working in each of the following four occupations: fishers, street vendors, public bus drivers, and traffic police in an environmentally polluted community in Thailand. The subject's behaviors were categorized into four groups: desirable health behaviors (non-smokers and non-drinkers), non-smokers who consume alcohol, smokers who do not consume alcohol, and undesirable health behaviors (frequent smokers and alcohol consumers). Data were collected at the end of the workday using interview forms, urine, and blood samples. Urine was analyzed for 1,2-DCE, and blood was analyzed for complete blood count (CBC), liver, and kidney function enzymes. Data were analyzed using the Dunnett's test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and independent sample t-test according to statistical conditions. Our findings revealed that the median urinary 1,2-DCE level was 0.080 mg/L (0.022–0.462 mg/L). Subjects with undesirable health behaviors had a significantly higher urinary 1,2-DCE level (0.108 mg/L) compared to those with desirable health behaviors (0.056 mg/L), with a p-value of 0.009. Among bus drivers and local fishers, the dose of exposure was strongly associated with creatinine levels (p = 0.006). No significant association was observed between exposure dose and CBC across all groups. In conclusion, the urinary samples present a small variation in 1,2-DCE concentrations and thus can be used as a benchmark baseline value for monitoring exposure among outdoor workers in areas with intense air pollution. Kidney function markers can be considered in monitoring the health effects of 1,2-DCE.",

We imparted n and p-type doping to the flakes using 1,2 dichloroethane and UV ozone treatment respectively. The n-type doping caused by 1,2, dichloroethane is due to the replacement of chlorine atoms by sulfur vacancies. The p-type doping by UV ozone is due to the solvation of ozone molecules by the water adlayer on MoS2. We have also discussed the impact of dopants and broadband lights as an external stimulus on the electrical behavior of MoS2. We see a difference in the behavior of the broadband lights on the electrical signal when doped via 1,2 dichloroethane compared to UV ozone. We saw significantly higher currents after doping in 1,2 dichloroethane even at low voltages attributed to the n-type doping effect. The broadband lights suppress the electrical response after 1,2 dichloroethane doping.

    "abstract": "The use of ionic liquids (ILs) in the biorefinery process has been increasing for the past few decades. In biorefinery, the separation process with respect to sugars needs to be evaluated for an efficient process design. Therefore, the present work aims to investigate the separation of sugars and ILs by means of a precipitation process using an antisolvent method. For this purpose, both theoretical and experimental studies were conducted. Initially, the conductor-like screening model for real solvents model was employed to screen the suitable antisolvents for the separation of sugars from the ILs. From the screening study, dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,2-dichloroethane were found to be the better antisolvents for the separation process. With the selected antisolvents, precipitation experiments were conducted for the mixtures involving four different sugars and three ILs at different experimental conditions. The process variables such as different antisolvents, sugars, ILs, antisolvent–IL molar ratios, and temperatures were examined in terms of their effect on sugar removal and IL recovery. DCM was found to be the most suitable antisolvent in this study with 90–99% of sugar removal and 80–98% of IL recovery. Further, molecular dynamics simulations were adopted to understand the structural properties of carbohydrates with ILs and antisolvents via interaction energies, hydrogen bonding, and coordination numbers. It was observed that the interaction energy between the sugars and IL plays a critical role in the removal of sugar. Higher the interaction energy between the sugars and IL, lower is the sugar removal.",

The catalytic performances of these catalysts can be related to the nature of each MOy support, the crystal structure and composition, the surface elements distribution and the diverse redox properties of (Ce,Cr)xO2/MOy. The improved redox property, as well as the increased content of Ce3+ and Cr6+ species on the surface can enhance the catalytic performances of the catalysts.

Our method is also compatible with the GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) technique using helium as the mobile phase instead of nitrogen. The successful separation of benzene and 1,2-dichloroethane was established by confirmation of their corresponding specific molecular masses.Results: The retention time of benzene and 1,2-dichloroethane were found to be 34.8 min and 35.6 min, respectively. The linearity was found in the range of concentration of 0.63-4.22 ppm and 1.49-9.96 ppm for benzene and 1,2-dichloroethane. The detection limit and quantification limit for benzene were 0.2 and 0.6 ppm, while those of 1,2-dichloroethane were 0.6 ppm and 1.5 ppm. These values were calculated using our developed method with respect to the test concentration of 500 mg/ml.

    "abstract": "Background Bioaugmentation is now a well-established approach for attenuating toxic groundwater and soil contaminants, particularly for chlorinated ethenes and ethanes. The KB-1 and WBC-2 consortia are cultures used for this purpose. These consortia contain organisms belonging to the Dehalococcoidia, including strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi in KB-1 and of both D. mccartyi and Dehalogenimonas in WBC-2. These tiny anaerobic bacteria couple respiratory reductive dechlorination to growth and harbour multiple reductive dehalogenase genes (rdhA) in their genomes, the majority of which have yet to be characterized. Results Using a combination of Illumina mate-pair and paired-end sequencing we closed the genomes of eight new strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi found in three related KB-1 sub-cultures that were enriched on trichloroethene (TCE), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) and vinyl chloride (VC), bringing the total number of genomes available in NCBI to 24. A pangenome analysis was conducted on 24 Dehalococcoides genomes and five Dehalogenimonas genomes (2 in draft) currently available in NCBI. This Dehalococcoidia pangenome generated 2875 protein families comprising of 623 core, 2203 accessory, and 49 unique protein families. In Dehalococcoides mccartyi the complement of reductive dehalogenase genes varies by strain, but what was most surprising was how the majority of rdhA sequences actually exhibit a remarkable degree of synteny across all D. mccartyi genomes. Several homologous sequences are also shared with Dehalogenimonas genomes. Nucleotide and predicted protein sequences for all reductive dehalogenases were aligned to begin to decode the evolutionary history of reductive dehalogenases in the Dehalococcoidia. Conclusions The conserved synteny of the rdhA genes observed across Dehalococcoides genomes indicates that the major differences between strain rdhA gene complement has resulted from gene loss rather than recombination. These rdhA have a long evolutionary history and trace their origin in the Dehalococcoidia prior to the speciation of Dehalococcoides and Dehalogenimonas. The only rdhA genes suspected to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer are protein-coding rdhA that have been identified to catalyze dehalogenation of industrial pollutants. Sequence analysis suggests that evolutionary pressures resulting in new rdhA genes involve adaptation of existing dehalogenases to new substrates, mobilization of rdhA between genomes or within a genome, and to a lesser degree manipulation of regulatory regions to alter expression.",

Among these, C16–18 heavy alkyl benzene sulfonates possess an excellent ability to reduce the oil-water interface tension. In this study, hexadecylbenzene sulfonic acid (HBSA) was synthesised in a continuous stirred-tank microreactor using a continuous method with 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC) dilution. Post-sulfonation liquid SO3 solution was used as a sulfonating agent for hexadecylbenzene (HDB). The effects of reaction conditions, such as the SO3:HDB molar ratio, sulfonation temperature and sulfonation agent concentration, on the yield and purity of the product were investigated. Optimisation of the reaction process yielded high-quality HBSA samples with a purity exceeding 99 wt%. The continuous sulfonation process significantly enhanced the production and efficiency in the case of a considerably short residence time (10 s) in the reactor, without the need for aging. The results of this study demonstrate significant potential for application in industrial production.",

The carcinogenic risk assessed by human exposure to site VOCs through ingestion, respiration, exposure, etc., exceeded the potentially acceptable level (1.0 × 10−6). 1,2,3-trichloropropane has the highest carcinogenic risk across all pathways, regions, and populations. The long-term exposure and emission of VOCs in the investigated sites could likely pose an adverse health risk to site staff and the surrounding sensitive groups.

The reduction behavior of the oxide precursor NiO/Al2O3 was studied by thermogravimetric analysis in a hydrogen medium. A thermodynamic assessment of the conditions under which metallic nickel undergoes deactivation due to the formation of nickel chloride was performed. The dechlorination of chlorinated substrates was studied using a gravimetric flow-through system equipped with McBain balances in a wide range of temperatures (350–650 °C) and hydrogen concentrations (0–98 vol%). The impact of these parameters on selectivity towards the products of hydrodechlorination (C2H4, C2H6, and C6H6) and catalytic pyrolysis (carbon nanomaterial and CH4) was explored. The relationship between the mechanisms of the catalytic hydrodechlorination and the carbide cycle was discussed, and the specific reaction conditions for the implementation of both scenarios were revealed.

To completely eliminate PNP, 1,2-DCA and intermediates from polluted sites, in this study, a novel degrader KTU-PDG was created by functional assembly of PNP and 1,2-DCA biodegradation pathways in a robust chassis Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Cell growth assay indicated that PNP or 1,2-DCA can be metabolized as a sole carbon source by strain KTU-PDG for cell proliferation. Stable isotope analysis indicated that strain KTU-PDG possesses the capability of co-mineralizing PNP and 1,2-DCA to CO2 in mineral salt medium. In wastewater bioremediation, the strain KTU-PDG was proven to be capable of co-mineralizing PNP and DCA and maintained high cell viability during bioremediation. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time co-mineralization of PNP and 1,2-DCA by a single strain. Moreover, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeling of strain KTU-PDG facilitates estimation of viable cell number and real-time monitoring of cellular activity and transfer by autofluorescence in the environment. These merits of strain KTU-PDG highlight great potential of this degrader for in situ bioremediation of sites co-contaminated with PNP and 1,2-DCA.

    "abstract": "2-Chloroethanol (2-CE) is one of the reactive metabolites of 1,2-DCE in vivo, which might contribute to brain edema formation induced by 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) poisoning. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathways in upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in 2-CE exposed rat astrocytes. Expression of p38 MAPK (p38), extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and MMP-9 at both protein and gene levels in rat astrocytes were determined using western blot and real-time RT-PCR methods. The results showed that both protein and mRNA levels of MMP-9 in 2-CE exposed astrocytes significantly increased. Meanwhile, protein levels of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and JNK1/2 (p-JNK1/2) in 2-CE exposed astrocytes also significantly increased. In addition, both protein and mRNA levels of MMP-9 significantly decreased in response to reduced protein levels of p-p38, p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK1/2 achieved by supplement with their specific inhibitors, indicating that activation of MAPK signal pathways might play an important role in upregulation of MMP-9 expression at the transcriptional level in 2-CE exposed astrocytes. Furthermore, since pretreatment of n-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a powerful antioxidant amino acid, could attenuate the elevated levels of MMP-9, p-p38, p-ERK2 and p-JNK1/2 in 2-CE exposed astrocytes, activation of MAPK signal pathways in 2-CE exposed astrocytes could be mediated partially by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was most likely generated in the metabolism of 2-CE.",

    "abstract": "Chlorinated volatile organic compounds come from a wide range of sources and are highly toxic, posing a serious threat to biological health and the environment. Herein, a high-efficiency and energy-saving photothermal synergistic catalytic oxidation method was developed for the removal of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). Compared to traditional thermocatalysis, the 1,2-DCE conversion over Ru-U6S in photothermal synergistic catalysis at 340 °C increased by approximately 44% not only reducing energy consumption but also avoiding the instability of MOF structure caused by high reaction temperature. The excellent photothermal catalytic oxidation activity was derived from the synergistic effect of photo- and thermocatalysis. Ru-U6S demonstrated excellent 1,2-DCE adsorption capacity and stronger light utilization and could produce more reactive oxygen species (•OH and •O2-) after light illumination, which participated in the oxidation reaction, promoting the release of the active site of the catalyst. The results of H2O-TPD and NH3-DRIFTS exhibited that the use of S-containing ligands in the synthesis process increased the hydroxyl groups and Brønsted acid sites, significantly improved the selectivity of CO2 and HCl in the oxidation process, and reduced the release of chlorine-containing byproducts.

As found, the interaction of bulk Ni-Cr alloy with the reaction medium containing halogenated hydrocarbons (1,2-dichloroethane, 1-iodobutane, 1-bromobutane) results in the appearance of ferromagnetic particles of similar dimensions (~200–300 nm).

    "abstract": "1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) contamination has emerged as a notable threat to human health and ecological stability. However, studies on 1,2-DCA-contaminated soils are limited. Further, the remediation potential of bacterial genera capable of the aerobic degradation of 1,2-DCA and their use in the remediation of actual 1,2-DCA-contaminated soils have not yet been comprehensively investigated. To address these research gaps, in the present study, we isolated a novel 1,2-DCA-degrading bacterial strain from 1,2-DCA contaminated soil, identified as Ancylobacter sp. BL1 using 16 S rRNA gene analysis and physiological and biochemical tests. The optimal conditions for degradation by strain BL1 were predicted using response surface methodology, and the degradation kinetics was studied. The metabolic pathway of 1,2-DCA in strain BL1 follows a hydrolytic dehalogenation mechanism. The key genes (dhlA, dhlB, max, and ald) involved in 1,2-DCA degradation exhibited significant homology with previously reported genes except for dhlB, which was located on a large plasmid together with dhlA. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, an efficient 1,2-DCA-degrading strain, BL1, was utilized for remediating actual 1,2-DCA-contaminated soil. Our findings demonstrated that strain BL1 effectively degraded approximately 86 % of 235 mg/kg of soil 1,2-DCA within 5 days. Bioaugmentation with the isolated strain did not considerably disturb the original microbial communities of the soil, increasing the abundances of microbial flora beneficial to organic carbon degradation and restoring soil enzyme activity.

Methods. The bifunctional chelate p-SCN-Bn-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic-acid (DOTA) was dissolved in deionized water, added to pertuzumab solution, and stirred overnight at room temperature to obtain the product DOTA pertuzumab. 1,2-dichloroethane and N-hydroxysuccinimide were added to activate the carboxyl group on DOTA. After 0.5 hr of activation, the amino fluorescent dye Cy5.5 was further added to react with it to synthesize the intermediate product Cy5.5-DOTA-pertuzumab. Finally, we added GdCl3-6H2O and placed it in a magnetic stirrer for 6 hr before the unreacted substance was removed by dialysis to obtain Gd-Cy5.5-pertuzumab. Following that, the hydrated particle size and zeta potential of the nanoprobe were measured by particle size analyzer, the fluorescence spectrum by a fluorescence detector, the infrared spectrum by the infrared analyzer, the cytotoxicity by CCK-8 method, the relaxation rate by Niumai small nuclear magnetic field, and the binding ability of HER2 to thyroid cancer 8505C by laser confocal microscope. Nanoprobes were injected into a subcutaneous thyroid cancer nude mouse model through the tail vein, and in vivo MRI and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging were performed. Finally, the nude mice were dissected and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of pathological tissues was performed to evaluate the imaging performance of the prepared bimodal probes. Results. The synthesized bimodal probe Gd-Cy5.5-pertuzumab had a hydrodynamic size of 131.34 ± 9.43 nm and zeta potential of −31.73 ± 6.24 mV with a significant absorption peak at 685 nm. The relaxation rate of the probe was 46.53 mM−1 s−1, which was determined by Niumai small nuclear magnetism, and the T1 signal intensity increased gradually with the concentration of the probe. Laser confocal microscopy showed that HER2 was mainly expressed in cell membranes. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the probe had low cytotoxicity. MRI and small animal fluorescence imaging of tumor-bearing nude mice showed that the probe could clearly image tumor tissue. Conclusion.

Our results revealed that brain water content and BBB permeability increased significantly in the intoxicated mice. Meanwhile, the levels of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) and inhibitory κBα (p-IκB), as well as the expression levels of MMP-9, c-jun, c-fos, and p65, also increased markedly in the brains of intoxicated mice. Conversely, the protein levels of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 in these mice decreased markedly, but their JAM-1 protein levels increased dramatically. Our results revealed that p-p38 levels in the brains of intoxicated mice were suppressed by pretreatment with a p38 inhibitor. In response to suppressed p-p38 levels, the brain water contents and DNA binding activities of NF-κB and AP-1, as well as the expression levels of MMP-9, c-jun, c-fos, p65, p-IκB and JAM-1, decreased, whereas the protein levels of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 increased markedly. Taken together, our findings indicated that the p38 signaling pathway might be activated and involved in the course of brain edema in 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice.",

    "abstract": "Two spectrophotometric procedures are developed for the estimation of three antihepatitic drugs namely Voxilaprevir (VOXL), Sofosbuvir (SOFOS) and Velpatasvir (VELP) in pure form and in different pharmaceutical formulations. The first method is based on the oxidation of velpatasvir and sofosbuvir with potassium iodate in an acidic medium followed by extracting the liberated iodine with cyclohexane and measurement at λ= 525 nm. Beer’s law is valid in the concentration ranges from 10–400 and 5–400 µg/ml for velpatasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The apparent molar absorptivity of the resulting-colored complex was found to be 1.34 × 10 for velpatasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The second method is based on the interaction of the antithepatatis drugs, Voxilaprevir, Velpatasvir and sofosbuvir in 1,2-dichloroethane with bromophenol blue (BPB), bromocresol green (BCG) and bromocresol purple (BCP) in the same solvent to produce stable colored ion pairs with maximum absorbance at 385–405 nm. Regression analysis of Beer’s plots showed good correlation in the concentration ranges 10–60, 10–60 and 5–40 µg/mL for voxilaprevir and 1.64 × 103 l.mol−1.cm−1 for velpatasvir, 10–150, 10–150 and 10–60 µg/mL−for sofosbuvir with BPB, BCG and BCP reagents, respectively. The limit of detection is 0.46–7.69 µgml11 for sofosbuvir and 10–250, 10–150 and 10–100 µgml−1 and limits of quantitation range between 1.52–8.53 µgml1. The optimum assay conditions were investigated and the recovery of the drugs from their dosage forms ranged from 99.33% to 100.5%. Intraday relative standard deviations (RSD) were 0.029–1.397% and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.9992 to 1.

    "abstract": "Anionic surfactants (AS) are detrimental aquatic pollutants due to their well-characterized toxicity to aquatic organisms. The concentration of AS in aquatic environments is increasing because of their extensive use in many industries and households. The standard reference method for AS analysis is to determine a methylene blue active substance (MBAS) complex formed between AS and the methylene blue (MB) cation by using chloroform. However, chloroform has a low AS extraction efficiency and other limiting properties, such as a high density and volatility, which make the conventional AS analytical method time-consuming and labor-intensive. In an effort to replace the use of chloroform, this study was carried out to screen novel solvents for their ability to extract AS in water samples. Criteria were based on AS extraction efficiency, physicochemical properties, and the stability of the solvent under different environmental conditions. Organic solvents, such as methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), dichloromethane, benzene, and n-hexane, were assessed. In extraction of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), the mixture of MIBK-DCE (3:1) proved to be an optimum solvent as an alternative to chloroform. It not only enhanced SDS extractability but also improved properties, such as having a lower volatility, a lower density than water, and a quicker phase separation. Among solvents screened, no one single solvent in SDS extraction could meet such criteria. The performance of the MIBK-DCE (3:1) mixture in SDS extraction was stable, irrespective of pH and ionic strength of the SDS solution, washing process, and presence of cations. Anionic interference from halogen and polyatomic and organic anions in SDS extraction by MIBK-DCE (3:1) existed only at an elevated concentration, which is not occurring in the natural aquatic environment. Results demonstrated that a MIBK-DCE (3:1) mixture solvent could be used in AS analysis for a wide range of aquatic samples and it could be the basis for the development of a new analytical method to replace conventional chloroform.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Large and effective reductions in emissions of long-lived ozone-depleting substance (ODS) are being achieved through the Montreal Protocol, the effectiveness of which can be seen in the declining atmospheric abundances of many ODSs. An important remaining uncertainty concerns the role of very short-lived substances (VSLSs) which, owing to their relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (less than 6 months), are not regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Recent studies have found an unexplained increase in the global tropospheric abundance of one VSLS, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), which has increased by around 60 % over the past decade. Here we report dramatic enhancements of several chlorine-containing VSLSs (Cl-VSLSs), including CH2Cl2 and CH2ClCH2Cl (1,2-dichloroethane), observed in surface and upper-tropospheric air in East and South East Asia. Surface observations were, on occasion, an order of magnitude higher than previously reported in the marine boundary layer, whilst upper-tropospheric data were up to 3 times higher than expected. In addition, we provide further evidence of an atmospheric transport mechanism whereby substantial amounts of industrial pollution from East Asia, including these chlorinated VSLSs, can rapidly, and regularly, be transported to tropical regions of the western Pacific and subsequently uplifted to the tropical upper troposphere. This latter region is a major provider of air entering the stratosphere, and so this mechanism, in conjunction with increasing emissions of Cl-VSLSs from East Asia, could potentially slow the expected recovery of stratospheric ozone.",

The hydrolysis and co-condensation of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (CPTES) took place during the preparation process. MoO2(acac)2 was then introduced into the mesoporous silica functionalized with a Schiff base ligand. The structural properties of the prepared catalysts were investigated by a series of techniques, such as elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption/desorption curves, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results demonstrated that the MoVI Schiff base complex was successfully tethered on the silica support, and the hexagonally ordered mesoporous structure of the SBA-15-type silica was well retained after the anchoring reaction. The heterogeneous catalyst showed good catalytic activities in the liquid-phase epoxidation of olefins with t-BuOOH as the oxygen source in 1,2-dichloroethane solvent at 80°C. Several important factors, including oxidant-to-substrate ratio, solvent, and catalyst reusability, were investigated. Under the optimum reaction conditions, using this heterogeneous catalyst for the cyclohexene epoxidation reaction, a high conversion of 97.20 % and selectivity of &amp;gt;99 % was achieved after 4 h, while the catalytic activity nearly remained unchanged over four runs.",

The epoxidation of α-pinene with H2O2 was catalysed by tungsten-based polyoxometalates without any solvent. The variables in the screening parameters were temperatures (30–70 °C), oxidant amount (100–200 mol%), acid concentrations (0.02–0.09 M) and solvent types (i.e., 1,2-dichloroethane, toluene, p-cymene and acetonitrile). Screening the process parameters revealed that almost 100% selective epoxidation of α-pinene to α-pinene oxide was possible with negligible side product formation within a short reaction time (∼20 min), using process conditions of a 50 °C temperature in the absence of solvent and α-pinene/H2O2/catalyst molar ratio of 5 : 1 : 0.01. A kinetic investigation showed that the reaction was first-order for α-pinene and catalyst concentration, and a fractional order (∼0.5) for H2O2 concentration. The activation energy (Ea) for the epoxidation of α-pinene was ∼35 kJ mol−1. The advantages of the epoxidation reported here are that the reaction could be performed isothermally in an organic solvent-free environment to enhance the reaction rate, achieving nearly 100% selectivity to α-pinene oxide.",

The encapsulated guest was successfully removed from the complex without racemization through precipitation of the empty capsule. CD spectra confirmed that the chirality of the capsule was maintained in THF and 1,4‐dioxane for long periods, whereas a small amount of acetonitrile accelerated racemization of the empty capsule. The activation parameters of the racemization reaction were determined in dichloromethane and 1,2‐dichloroethane, resulting in positive enthalpic contributions and large negative entropic contributions, respectively. Accordingly, the racemization fits a first‐order kinetic model. Mechanically coupled Cu+‐2,2′‐bipyridine coordination centers were responsible for the high‐energy barrier of racemization and led to the unique chiral memory of the dissymmetric cavity, which was turned off by the addition of acetonitrile.",

    "abstract": "Trans-interfacial behaviors of multiple ionic species at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) are of importance to biomembrane mimicking, chemical and biosensing, and interfacial molecular catalysis. Utilizing host-guest interaction to facilitate ion transfer is an effective and commonly used method to decrease the Gibbs energy of transfer of a target molecule. Herein, we investigated a facilitated ion transfer (FIT) process of poly(amidoamine)dendrimer (PAMAM, G0-G2) by dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6) at the microinterfaces between water and 1,2-dichloroethane (μ-W/DCE). Because of the host-guest interaction between a dendrimer and a ligand, negative shifts of the transfer potentials were observed using cyclic voltammetry or Osteryoung square wave voltammetry. From the FIT behavior of the dendrimer, we revealed that each DB18C6 could selectively coordinate with one amino group. We first evaluated the protonated status of the intermediate state (1:2) exactly under the conditions the dendrimer (G1) transfers across the interface using the electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS)-hyphenated technique, which is much smaller than the protonated status in the water phase (1:8 to 14). Using the same methodology, we also studied the facilitated transfer behaviors of G0 and G2. Based on these results, we put forward the mechanism of the FIT process, which might involve a deprotonating process at the interface for higher-generation dendrimers.",

Various ND layers are examined employing as-received and hydrogenated nanoparticles. As expected, the hydrogen plasma treatment improves strongly the photoemission of the layer giving a QE of 22% at 146 nm. Indeed, this efficiency value is achieved only if the particles are treated in H2 microwave plasma before the growth of the sprayed layer rather than to hydrogenate the already formed one.

    "abstract": "This study presents an assessment of the protection provided by water intake and treatment systems against potential health risk to water consumers. To perform the assessment a case study was conducted involving modelling and risk assessment based on scenarios of decreasing water quality at the intakes (i.e. emergency situations). The study sites were two continuously operating water treatment plants in Southern Poland (CEE). The study material were the results of tests conducted in the years 2012–2019 on samples of water taken directly at the intakes and samples of treated water. The samples were used to determine the concentration of selected metals (Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn), organic pollutants (benzo(a)pyrene, benzene, acrylamide, epichlorohydrin, vinyl chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane) and bacteriological pollutants ( Coliform bacteria , Escherichia coli , Enterococcus faecali and Clostridium perfringens ). The non-carcinogenic (HI) and carcinogenic (CR) hazard indexes were estimated based on the quality of water at the intake using linear regression models. The risk values obtained were compared with permissible values specified in the US EPA methodology. It was demonstrated that the concentrations of the xenobiotics analysed in treated water would have to increase 11 times in the case of adults and 29 times in the case of children before the risk level related to drinking water exceeded permissible values. In the least favourable exposure scenario modelled, assuming the presence of organic xenobiotics in potable water, the total HI amounts to only 10% of the permissible value in adults and 1.5% in children. The total CR calculated for the 3-times lower water quality did not exceed permissible values, which proves that the water treatment systems are safe.",

    "abstract": "Many research results showed that the CGPR concentration in the blood plasma has significantly increased by hepatopathies with different genesis. The hyperkinetic portal blood flow has caused this. This research's primary hypothesis was the potentiation of CGPR ‐ receptor antagonist to the liver's plastic process by toxical hepatopathies provocation. The study aimed to evaluate the influence of combination the hepatoprotective agent “Hepaton‐vet” (dose ‐0.5 mg/kg per rat during 7th days) and monoclonal antibodies G2 (IgG2, dose ‐0.75 ml/kg per rat one‐time before experimental start) on the hepatopathy's regenerative process which was 1,2‐dichloroethane induced during 7th days with following orthothanasia (the method by Malcom A., Steele M.D., 1991). White outbred rats were used (n=20). The body mass of rats was ranged from 180 to 220g. The liver histological examinations were performed by a visual method using Image J Software. Thus, the histologic pattern of rats' liver was included in the connective tissue membrane, which was obduced the liver externally. The hepatic lobules of rats have had shapes of hexagon prism without clean‐cut peripheries. The interlobular tissue in the lobule's feather included the interlobular vena, the interlobular artery, and the bile duct lined with cuboidal epithelium. The lobular base was sited central vein with hepatic plates, which were formed hepatocytes. The rats' hepatocytes had a wrong multiangular shape were was 60 % of all in the liver cells pattern was typical for liver with high regenerative level without signs of vassal‐ mesenchymal reactions, which was correlated with CGPR ‐ receptor antagonist. So, we can assume that the CGPR ‐ receptor antagonist drugs have a great variety in their administration, including the potentiation of other drugs used in the pharmacorrection of different pathologies. The balanced influence on the CGPR – receptors significantly influence the homeostasis maintenance and the nociception of the hepatobiliary system.",

    "abstract": "Background As LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) is being increasingly used for the diagnosis and treatment of uterine cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, surgical smoke during LEEP has become an inevitable health issue. Therefore, in this study, exposure to the chemical substances in surgical smoke produced during LEEP was assessed. Methods Smoke samples from patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia undergoing LEEP were collected by smoke-absorbing devices situated 1 m away from the operating table and near the nose of the operator during LEEP. Each plume sample was collected after 5 patients underwent LEEP, requiring 5 min for smoke collection for each patient. The chemicals of exposure to surgical smoke were assessed, and the hazard classes of these chemical components were evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Results Qualitative analysis of the smoke produced during LEEP revealed a variety of potentially toxic chemicals under standard detection, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene, butyl acetate, acrylonitrile, 1,2-dichloroethane, phenol, chlorine, cyanide, hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. Additionally, the average concentration of carbon dioxide was 0.098 ± 0.015% during surgery and was higher than that before surgery (0.072 ± 0.007%, P < 0.001), and the concentration of formaldehyde was significantly higher during surgery (0.023 ± 0.009 mg/m 3 , P < 0.05) than before surgery (0.012 ± 0.001 mg/m 3 , P < 0.05). Conclusions Most of the detected chemical concentrations in smoke generated during LEEP were below the exposure limits when local exhaust ventilation procedures were efficiently used. However, the concentrations of carbon dioxide and formaldehyde found in smoke were significantly higher after surgery. Wearing a high-filtration mask and using evacuation devices routinely and consistently when performing LEEP are recommended to protect perioperative personnel.",

    "abstract": "Aqueous-phase catalyzed reduction of organic contaminants via zerovalent copper nanoparticles (nCu^0), coupled with borohydride (hydrogen donor), has shown promising results. So far, the research on nCu^0 as a remedial treatment has focused mainly on contaminant removal efficiencies and degradation mechanisms. Our study has examined the effects of Cu^0/Cu^n+ ratio, surface poisoning (presence of chloride, sulfides, humic acid (HA)), and regeneration of Cu^0 sites on catalytic dechlorination of aqueous-phase 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) via nCu^0-borohydride. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the nano size and quasi-spherical shape of nCu^0 particles. X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of Cu^0 and Cu_2O and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also provided the Cu^0/Cu^n+ ratios. Reactivity experiments showed that nCu^0 was incapable of utilizing H_2 from borohydride left over during nCu^0 synthesis and, hence, additional borohydride was essential for 1,2-DCA dechlorination. Washing the nCu^0 particles improved their Cu^0/Cu^n+ ratio (1.27) and 92% 1,2-DCA was removed in 7 h with k _ obs  = 0.345 h^−1 as compared to only 44% by unwashed nCu^0 (0.158 h^−1) with Cu^0/Cu^n+ ratio of 0.59, in the presence of borohydride. The presence of chloride (1000–2000 mg L^−1), sulfides (0.4–4 mg L^−1), and HA (10–30 mg L^−1) suppressed 1,2-DCA dechlorination; which was improved by additional borohydride probably via regeneration of Cu^0 sites. Coating the particles decreased their catalytic dechlorination efficiency. 85–90% of the removed 1,2-DCA was recovered as chloride. Chloroethane and ethane were main dechlorination products indicating hydrogenolysis as the major pathway. Our results imply that synthesis parameters and groundwater solutes control nCu^0 catalytic activity by altering its physico-chemical properties. Thus, these factors should be considered to develop an efficient remedial design for practical applications of nCu^0-borohydride.",

We found that both fatty acids can undergo a simple interfacial ion transfer reaction that is mainly limited by diffusion. The possibility of spontaneous partitioning of the fatty acid into the organic phase and acting as a ligand for the facilitated sodium ion transfer was excluded. The ionic currents originating from the chemical species interfacial transfer were recorded starting from a pH of around 8.5, which agreed with their poor acidity. The acid-base properties of fatty acids were studied with pKa 9.7 (for oleic acid) and 8.5 for the 9/10-nitro derivative. The formal Galvani potential difference of the fatty acids ion transfer reaction was used to calculate the water-1,2-dichloroethane partition coefficients. The results indicated similar water solubility for 9/10-nitro oleic acid (logP' −3.47) and oleic acid (logP' −3.42), where 9/10-nitro oleic acid is slightly more hydrophilic. The partial water solubility of the fatty acids was confirmed by the measurement of ionic currents, which did not increase linearly with their increasing aqueous phase concentration. The obtained results were correlated with the dynamic light scattering of the fatty acids, indicating the formation of supramolecular structures. 9/10-Nitro oleic acid is an endogenously produced signaling molecule involved in cell redox homeostasis.

    "abstract": "Suppressing toxic polychlorinated byproducts during chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) destruction remains a critical challenge. Strengthening the Cl desorption and promoting rapid deep oxidation of reaction intermediates, thereby cutting off the interaction between Cl and reaction intermediates, is an effective strategy to prevent the formation of polychlorinated byproducts. Herein, a CuSO4/TiO2 catalyst with dual-reaction channels was developed for 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) oxidation, featuring S═O-H sites for Cl desorption and Cu-O-S sites for intermediate oxidation. It achieved 90% conversion at 251 °C, with reaction rates 8.3 and 11.0 times higher than those of SO42-/TiO2 and CuO/TiO2, respectively. The hybridization of Cu 3d-O 2p enhanced electron transfer of O → Cu, accelerating 1,2-DCE oxidation via the C═C-OH → - COO/C═O → CO pathway. Meanwhile, the Cl species generated after C-Cl dissociation combined with S═O-H and desorbed in the form of HCl, avoiding Cl binding to intermediates and thus inhibiting the generation of CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, CH2ClCHCl2, and CCl2CCl2. Notably, the S═O-H species as a dynamic H transfer site could capture the H of the activated intermediates after being consumed by the Cl species during the reaction, restoring the S═O-H structure and achieving stable desorption of Cl species. This study highlights the previously overlooked matching of chlorine desorption with the intermediate oxidation process, offering a highly efficient solution for CVOC purification.",

The prepared Co3O4/CePO4 using ascorbic acid (AA) as a chelating agent presented a high activity and low selectivity of vinyl chloride (VC) for catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) due to the high dispersion of Co3O4, compared with bulk Co3O4 and Co3O4/SiO2, possible polychlorinated byproducts were completely inhibited in the presence of CePO4 support.

Only one group of pepper seeds (number 7) has been purchased commercially. Before conducting the experiment, the collected peppers have been stored in a refrigerator (5 °C) within a week. The following characteristics of the peppers were studied: moisture content, dry matter and ash content. Static extraction of β-carotene from the peppers was carried out in four organic solvents, used as extractants (isopropanol, isobutanol, 1,1-dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane). The different organic solvents exhibited different extraction ability. The largest amount of β-carotene was extracted when polar organic solvents were used as extractants and first in terms of extraction ability was isopropanol, followed by isobutanol. The best organic solvent for extracting β-carotene from peppers proved to be isopropanol. The highest amount of β-carotene extracted by using isopropanol, was contained in sample № 7 (11.86±0.01 mg/100g of dry matter).",

    "abstract": "Medium polarity plays a crucial role in charge-transfer processes and electrochemistry. The added supporting electrolyte in electrochemical setups, essential for attaining the needed electrical conductivity, sets challenges for estimating medium polarity. Herein, we resort to Lippert–Mataga–Ooshika (LMO) formalism for estimating the Onsager polarity of electrolyte organic solutions pertinent to electrochemical analysis. An amine derivative of 1,8-naphthalimide proves to be an appropriate photoprobe for LMO analysis. An increase in electrolyte concentration enhances the polarity of the solutions. This effect becomes especially pronounced for low-polarity solvents. Adding 100 mM tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate to chloroform results in solution polarity exceeding that of neat dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. Conversely, the observed polarity enhancement that emerges upon the same electrolyte addition to solvents such as acetonitrile and N,N-dimethylformamide is hardly as dramatic. Measured refractive indices provide a means for converting Onsager to Born polarity, which is essential for analyzing medium effects on electrochemical trends. This study demonstrates a robust optical means, encompassing steady-state spectroscopy and refractometry, for characterizing solution properties important for charge-transfer science and electrochemistry.",

Batch experiments demonstrated that 1.5 g/L nZVC/BBC with 25 mmol/L KBH4 removed 86.94 % of 100 mg/L DCA from 100 mL aqueous solution within 12 h. The removal process followed Pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetics model, suggesting chemisorption as the dominant mechanism. The pH of the solution of 5–13 resulted in improved removal efficiency; therefore, the composite material was adaptable to a wide pH range. The co-existing ion SO4\n                     2− had inhibitory effects on the removal of 1,2-DCA, whereas the effects of other co-existing ions (K+, Ca2+, and HCO3\n                     −) were minimal. The nZVC/BBC could be regenerated using NaOH, achieving over 70 % efficiency after five cycles when combined with KBH4 for 1,2-DCA removal. Characterization of the nZVC/BBC composite after the reaction was performed using XRD and XPS analyses. Adsorption kinetic models and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated that the removal mechanism for 1,2-DCA involved both surface adsorption, pore filling and reduction reactions. In experiments using actual groundwater, the removal rate of 1,2-DCA reached 95 % when nZVC/BBC/KBH4 were 3.5 g/L and 35 mmol/L. This work has implications for the construction of materials for collaborative removal of 1,2-DCA from water by adsorption-reduction, and provides a new idea for water pollution control.",

Activating CVOC molecules and desorbing Cl species by modulating the metal-oxygen property is a promising strategy to fulfill these. Herein, a bifunctional CoRu/Al2O3 catalyst with synergistic Co and Ru interactions (Ru-O-Co species) was rationally fabricated, which possesses abundant surface Co2+ and Ruδ+ sites and collaboratively facilitates the activation of lattice oxygen (O2-) and molecular oxygen (O2 → O2- → O-), accelerating 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) decomposition via the reaction route of enolic species → aldehydes → carboxylate/carbonate. Furthermore, CoRu/Al2O3 stimulates 1,2-DCE oxidation under humid conditions as H2O molecules can be easily activated to active *OH (potential oxidizing agent) over Ru species, accelerating C-Cl dissociation and Cl desorption and promoting the transformation of catecholate-type (C═O) species to easily oxidizable carboxylic acid (COOH) species, remarkably suppressing the formation of hazardous CCl4 and CHCl2CH2Cl.

    "abstract": "The non-Bornian solvation model has been applied for predicting the adsorption equilibrium for nonionic surfactants at the oil (O)/water (W) interface. In the non-Bornian model, the small contribution from the long-range electrostatic interaction is ignored, then the solvation or resolvation energy is formulated based on short-range solute molecule (or ion)-solvent interactions: cavity formation, Coulomb, polarization, charge transfer, etc. These interaction energies are given by zero, first, and second-order functions of the local electric field (E_i) on the molecular surface, which can be estimated by DFT calculation. In the present study, we considered an adsorption process as \"partial\" transfer of a molecule across the O/W interface. Using a non-Bornian, semi-empirical equation for the Gibbs energy of transfer of nonionic molecules, the adsorption states of alkyl alcohols (1-dodecanol, 1-octanol, and 1-hexanol) at the 1,2-dichloroethane/W interface were successfully predicted. The orientation angle (θ), the rotation angle (ω), and the penetration depth into the O phase (d) of the alcohols in the adsorption state could be estimated. Furthermore, the energies for the adsorption from O and W (∆G_ad^(∘,O→I) and ∆G_ad^(∘,W→I)) could be estimated theoretically.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this study, the anaerobic microcosm systems under in-situ conditions were constructed using the soil and the groundwater collected at a former pesticide manufacturing site. The in-situ natural attenuation potential was evaluated and its relationships with the geochemistry conditions and the microbial communities were carefully explored. The site was heavily contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) including perchloroethylene (PCE) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA). The 0 ~ 20 mV redox conditions measured in both the heterogeneous soil and the groundwater favored a series of CHCs biodegradation correlated processes. The significant contributions of biodegradation processes to the attenuation of CHCs were confirmed by comparing the PCE and 1,2-DCA degradations as accompanied with Cl− accumulation rates between the unsterilized microcosms and the sterilized controls. The 16S rRNA gene based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed the distinct shifts of microbial community compositions in the soil and the groundwater microcosm systems during the incubation. The Shannon-Winner index analysis further suggested the decrease and the increase of microbial diversities in the soil and the groundwater samples, respectively. The dominant species mainly associated with phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. The recovered genera Geobacter, Streptomyces, and Acetoanaerobium associated 16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed the in-situ biological dechlorination potentials of CHCs. In summary, this study revealed high biological attenuation potentials with the suitable redox conditions for the studied actual CHCs contaminated site and indicated the high probability of the in-situ natural attenuation approach for CHCs contaminated site remediation.",

    "abstract": "The electrocatalytic reduction process is a promising technology for decomposing chlorinated organic pollutants in water but is limited by the lack of low-cost catalysts that can achieve high activity and selectivity. In studying electrochemical dechlorination of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) in aqueous media, we find that cobalt phthalocyanine molecules supported on carbon nanotubes (CoPc/CNT), which is a highly effective electrocatalyst for breaking the aliphatic C-Cl bonds in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) and trichloroethylene (TCE), are completely inactive for reducing the aromatic C-Cl bond in 2-CP. Detailed mechanistic investigation, including volcano plot correlation between dechlorination rate and atomic hydrogen adsorption energy on various transition metal surfaces, kinetic measurements, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, reveals that the reduction of the aromatic C-Cl bond in 2-CP goes through a hydrodechlorination mechanism featuring a bimolecular reaction between adsorbed atomic hydrogen and 2-CP on the catalyst surface, which requires neighboring catalytic sites, whereas the aliphatic C-Cl bonds in DCA and TCE are cleaved by direct electron transfer from the catalyst, which can occur on isolated single sites. This investigation leads to the discovery of metallic Co as a highly selective and active electrocatalyst for 2-CP dechlorination.

    "abstract": "Here we present a fundamental study on how the ground-state chemical reactivity of a molecule can be modified in a QED scenario, i.e., when it is placed inside a cavity and there is strong coupling between the cavity field and vibrational modes within the molecule. We work with a model system for the molecule (Shin-Metiu model) in which nuclear, electronic and photonic degrees of freedom are treated on the same footing. This simplified model allows the comparison of exact quantum reaction rate calculations with predictions emerging from transition state theory based on the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approach. We demonstrate that QED effects are indeed able to significantly modify activation barriers in chemical reactions and, as a consequence, reaction rates. The critical physical parameter controlling this effect is the permanent dipole of the molecule and how this magnitude changes along the reaction coordinate. We show that the effective coupling can lead to significant single-molecule energy shifts in an experimentally available nanoparticle-on-mirror cavity. We then apply the validated theory to a realistic case (internal rotation in the 1,2-dichloroethane molecule), showing how reactions can be inhibited or catalyzed depending on the profile of the molecular dipole. Furthermore, we discuss the absence of resonance effects in this process, which can be understood through its connection to Casimir-Polder forces. Finally, we treat the case of many-molecule strong coupling, and find collective modifications of reaction rates if the molecular permanent dipole moments are oriented with respected to the cavity field. This demonstrates that collective coupling can also provide a mechanism for modifying ground-state chemical reactivity of an ensemble of molecules coupled to a cavity mode.",

    "abstract": "The Maptaphut industrial area, one of the largest petrochemical complexes in Thailand, is the major cause of the various air pollutants. The larger concern is that a significant volume of air pollution is emitted and that air quality management needs to be improved. This is in part due to a lack of deeper understanding of how anthropogenic emissions are emitted from different sources in this area— especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Moreover, it has complicated relationship results of air pollution, disease mechanisms, and health effects. As a result, its available data can only give a rough indication of them. These factors are often assumed to be associated with economic consequences, but assessing the health-related economic losses caused by air pollution remains limited in many ways. Four targeted VOCs were analyzed, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and vinyl chloride from industrial and non-industrial sources, namely stacks, flares, storage tanks, wastewater treatment plants, transportation and marketing, fugitive losses, slurry/open equipment/vessel, and on-road mobile emissions. Source apportionment can be conducted using emissions inventory (EI) to establish pollution source databases, the dispersion model, and then imported on the risk model by determining receptors. The AERMOD dispersion model coupled with the IRAP-h view model was used to predict the spatial distribution of the ground-level concentration and analyze the inhalation health risk covering cancer and non-cancer risks— as well as the prioritization of pollutants. The risk assessment results indicated that the highest risk occurred most from 1,3-butadiene for cancer and chronic non-cancer risks contributed to fugitive sources, about 83% and 94%, and most benzenes for acute non-cancer risk contributed to on-road mobile sources, at about 56%. Consequently, the benzene classified as the most important priority depending on its risk results, comprehensive epidemiological studies, and discharge volumes. With the economic benefits assessment, BenMAP-CE was further utilized to estimate the health impacts and economic value of multiple scenarios to facilitate decision-making for benzene reduction. Overall, the 10% rollback policy for benzene concentration, monetized value of about 13.13 billion US dollars for all mortalities, gave the best practical scenario for the most economically viable option based on the B/C (benefit/cost) ratio results in Maptaphut. Ultimately, policymakers need to take additional measures to improve air quality and reduce health impacts while also considering economic benefits, especially benzene reduction.",

Despite the high demand for 1,2-DCA, it poses a risk to the environment because it is persistent and carcinogenic. Therefore, in this study, several reagents (dithionite, hydrosulfide, sulfite, persulfate, sulfate radicals, and hydroxyl radicals) were evaluated for the degradation of 1,2-DCA. Among these, the hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction were the most suitable oxidant, decomposing 92% of 1,2-DCA. Chloride, one of the final oxidized products, was observed, which supported the oxidation reaction. Moreover, with an increasing concentration of hydroxyl radicals, the degradation of 1,2-DCA increased. Furthermore, sufficient amounts of hydrogen peroxide were more important than Fe(II) in the decomposition of 1,2-DCA. The radical reaction can generate larger molecules via the degradation of 1,2-DCA, which are degraded over time. The applicability of Fenton oxidation was evaluated using real 1,2-DCA-contaminated groundwater. Although the degradation of target contaminant was lowered due to the alkaline pH and the presence of chloride and bicarbonate ions in groundwater, the Fenton reaction was still efficient to oxidize 1,2-DCA. These results indicate that Fenton oxidation is an effective technique for the treatment of 1,2-DCA in contaminated groundwater.",

We conducted an experiment with four pilot-scale constructed wetlands (0.81m2) in a greenhouse. Three SSCWs (T2, T3 and T4) were fed with real wastewater, and another one (T1) was fed with tap water (as plant control) to assess the role of T. angustifolia L. and their associated rhizobacteria to remediate 1,2-DCA. Tank T2 contained only sand without plants acting as contaminant control, tank T3 contained sand with plants and finally tank T4 contained plants with mixture of sand, soil and compost (3:2:1). The results show that the green technology has improved the removal of 1,2-DCA from the contaminated water through biodegradation with a remediation efficiency of 100% in T4 within 42 days.

Pronounced spatial heterogeneity was observed across stations, particularly for VOCs and heavy metals. Stations A, E, and F were dominated by alkanes, whereas stations B, C, and D exhibited higher proportions of oxygenated VOCs (mainly aldehydes and ketones). Across the network, formaldehyde (0.015 μg/m3), dichloromethane (2.60 μg/m3), toluene (2.53 μg/m3), and acetaldehyde (0.004 μg/m3) were identified as the most abundant species. Stations A and E served as VOC hotspots—formaldehyde peaked at station A and toluene at station E—likely due to nearby industrial and port activities. Concentrations of BTEX generally decreased throughout the study period, with a minor rebound at station C in 2022. Regarding heavy metals, elevated concentrations of lead (16.83 ng/m3), nickel (4.71 ng/m3), and arsenic (1.29 ng/m3) were observed at station A, again suggesting influences from industrial or port-related emissions.

The extraction efficacy of six HDES systems was initially evaluated, and the combinations of thymol/camphor (Thy/Cam) and menthol/thymol (Men/Thy) exhibited superior performance. Subsequently, these two HDESs were chosen for a comprehensive parametric analysis. The impact of contact time demonstrated that extraction equilibrium was reached at 15 min for both systems, thereby achieving a balance between high efficiency and time efficiency. Next, the impact of the HDES-to-water mass ratio was investigated. A 1:1 ratio was determined to be the most effective, as it minimized solvent consumption and provided high efficiency. An additional examination of the molar ratios of the HDES components revealed that the 1:1 ratio exhibited the most effective extraction performance. This was due to the fact that imbalances in the solvent mixture resulted in diminished efficiency as a result of disrupted molecular interactions. The extraction efficiency was significantly influenced by the initial concentration of 1,2-DCA, with higher concentrations resulting in superior results as a result of the increased mass transfer driving forces.

The efficiency of the extraction of metal ions with solutions of L in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) significantly increases in the presence of [C5(mim)2][Tf2N]2.

At present, long-term exposure to 1,2-DCE has been shown to cause cognitive dysfunction in some studies, but the mechanism is not clear. The results of this study showed that long-term 1,2-DCE exposure decreased learning and memory abilities in mice and impaired the structure and morphology of neurons in the hippocampal region. Moreover, except for the mRNA level of PAG, the enzymatic activities and protein levels of GS and PAG, as well as the mRNA level of GS were inhibited. With increasing dose of exposure, the protein and mRNA expression of GLAST and GLT-1 also decreased. Contrarily, there were protein and mRNA expression upregulation of GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B in the hippocampus, as well as increased levels of extracellular Glu and intracellular Ca2+. In addition, 1,2-DCE exposure also downregulated the protein expression levels of CaM, CaMKII and CREB. Taken together, our results suggest that long-term 1,2-DCE exposure impairs the learning and memory capacity in mice, which may be attributed to the disruption of Glu metabolism and the inhibition of CaM- CaMKII-CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus.",

In general, the reaction begins with dehydration between a carbonyl compound and an amine compound, forming an imine, which is then reduced to an alkylated amine product. Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (STAB) is a popular choice for the reducing agent as it shows selectivity for imines over aldehydes and ketones, which is particularly important in direct reductive amination where the imine and carbonyl compounds are present concurrently. Here, we analyze the reaction pathways of acid-catalyzed direct reductive amination in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) with acetaldehyde and methylamine. We find that the transition states for the formation and subsequent reduction of Z-methylethylideneimine (resultant aldimine from acetaldehyde and methylamine) have lower energies than the reduction of acetaldehyde. Transition state structures for the hydride transfers are organized by the Lewis-acidic sodium ion. Additionally, reduction reactions with formaldehyde and acetone and their imine derivatives (with methylamine) are investigated, and again, the hydride transfer to the resultant aldimine or ketimine is lower in energy than that of their parent carbonyl compound.",

However, the electron distribution and transfer considering dechlorination, methanogenesis, and other bioprocesses in these systems are little understood. This study investigated the electron fluxes in biocathode BES performing dechlorination of three typical CAHs, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE), 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA). Anaerobic sludge was inoculated to cathode and biocathode was acclimated by the direct acclimation and selection. The constructed biocathode at −0.26 V had significantly higher dechlorination efficiency (E24h > 99.0%) than the opened circuit (E24h of 17.2–27.5%) and abiotic cathode (E24h of 5.5–10.8%), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry analysis demonstrated the enhanced cathodic current and the positive shift of onset potential in the cathodic biofilm. Under autotrophic conditions with electrons from the cathode as sole energy source (columbic efficiencies of 80.4–90.0%) and bicarbonate as sole carbon source, CAHs dechlorination efficiencies were still maintained at 85.0 ± 2.0%, 91.4 ± 1.8%, and 84.9 ± 3.1% for PCE, TCE, and 1,2-DCA, respectively. Cis-1,2-dichloroethene was the final product for PCE and TCE, while 1,2-DCA went through a different dechlorination pathway with the non-toxic ethene as the final metabolite. Methane was the main by-product of the heterotrophic biocathode, and methane production could be enhanced to some extent by electrochemical stimulation. The various electron fluxes originating from the cathode and oxidation of organic substrates might be responsible for the enhanced CAHs dechlorination, while methane generation and bacterial growth would probably reduce the fraction of electrons provided for CAH dechlorination. The study deals with the dechlorination and competitive bioprocesses in CAH-dechlorinating biocathodes with a focus on electron fluxes.",

Results of the synthetic, NMR spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational studies suggest that, under given conditions, 2 is obtained by direct attack of 1 on the chloroethyl derivative 2-[(chloroethyl)thio]-1-methyl-1H-imidazole (3), rather than through the isolated stable thiiranium ion isomer, i.e., 7-methyl-2H, 3H, 7H-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-4-ium chloride (4a, orthorhombic, space group Pnma), or in analogy with similar reactions, through postulated, but unproven intermediate thiiranium ion 5. Furthermore, in the reaction with 1, 4a prefers isomerization to the N-chloroethyl derivative, 1-chloroethyl-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-1H-imidazole-2-thione (7), rather than alkylation to 2, while 7 further reacts with 1 to form 3-methyl-1-[(1-methyl-imidazole-2-yl)thioethyl]-1H-imidazole-2-thione (8, monoclinic, space group P 21/c). Additionally, during the isomerization of 3, the postulated intermediate thiiranium ion 5 was not detected by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods, nor by trapping with AgBF4.

It was found that the exact halogen substitutions on the periphery of dendrons exert a profound effect on the organogelation propensity, and dendrons Gn‐Cl (n=2, 3) and G2‐I proved to be highly efficient organogelators. The cooperation of multiple π–π, dispersive halogen, CH–π, and weak C−H⋅⋅⋅X hydrogen‐bonding interactions were found to be the key contributor to forming the self‐assembled gels. Dendritic organogels formed from Gn‐Cl (n=2, 3) in 1,2‐dichloroethane exhibited thixotropic‐responsive properties, and such thixotropic organogels are promising materials for future research and applications.",

    "abstract": "The cis- and trans-isomers of 6-(3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)cyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylic acid (cis-A and trans-A) were obtained by the reaction of 3,4-dichloro-N′-hydroxybenzimidamide and cis-1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride. Cocrystals of cis-A with appropriate solvents (cis-A‧½(1,2-DCE), cis-A‧½(1,2-DBE), and cis-A‧½C6H14) were grown from 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE), 1,2-dibromoethane (1,2-DBE), and a n-hexane/CHCl3 mixture and then characterized by X-ray crystallography. In their structures, cis-A is self-assembled to give a hybrid 2D supramolecular organic framework (SOF) formed by the cooperative action of O–H⋯O hydrogen bonding, Cl⋯O halogen bonding, and π⋯π stacking. The self-assembled cis-A divides the space between the 2D SOF layers into infinite hollow tunnels incorporating solvent molecules. The energy contribution of each noncovalent interaction to the occurrence of the 2D SOF was verified by several theoretical approaches, including MEP and combined QTAIM and NCIplot analyses. The consideration of the theoretical data proved that hydrogen bonding (approx. −15.2 kcal/mol) is the most important interaction, followed by π⋯π stacking (approx. −11.1 kcal/mol); meanwhile, the contribution of halogen bonding (approx. −3.6 kcal/mol) is the smallest among these interactions. The structure of the isomeric compound trans-A does not exhibit a 2D SOF architecture. It is assembled by the combined action of hydrogen bonding and π⋯π stacking, without the involvement of halogen bonds. A comparison of the cis-A structures with that of trans-A indicated that halogen bonding, although it has the lowest energy in cis-A-based cocrystals, plays a significant role in the crystal design of the hybrid 2D SOF. The majority of the reported porous halogen-bonded organic frameworks were assembled via iodine and bromine-based contacts, while chlorine-based systems—which, in our case, are structure-directing—were unknown before this study.",

Possible carcinogenicity and recalcitrance towards abiotic dechlorination has created considerable interest in developing remediation technologies to successfully treat 1,2-DCA. Recently, aqueous-phase catalyzed hydrodechlorination has emerged as a field-applicable technology showing promising results in reducing various COCs. However, there has been limited success in applying this technology to treat 1,2-DCA, even at the bench scale. In the current study, the feasibility of aqueous-phase catalyzed hydrodechlorination of 1,2-DCA was investigated over Pd nanoparticles (nPd) with the residual borohydride from nPd synthesis as a hydrogen (H2) source. nPd particles were synthesized via aqueous chemical reduction by sodium borohydride. Complete removal of 1,2-DCA (32 mg L−1) in <7 days was achieved with both bare and stabilized nPd (1 g L−1) particles and the reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. No additional injections of borohydride or any other H2 source were needed. Ethane was the main reaction product indicating hydrogenolysis as the major dechlorination pathway. Different synthesis parameters were found to affect the oxidation state, elemental composition and the catalytic activity of nPd and consequently 1,2-DCA dechlorination. Detailed surface characterization including TEM, SEM/EDX, XPS and XRD of nPd particles was conducted. This study is an initial step to show that even recalcitrant COCs like 1,2-DCA can be successfully treated in the aqueous-phase via nPd-borohydride suspensions, and likely other nanocatalysts, without any external/additional H2 source. However, further research is needed to provide more insight on how to transfer this technology from ideal laboratory conditions to real-field situations. The results also help provide clues on the development of a process level understanding of 1,2-DCA dechlorination via nanocatalysts.",

In this study, Co species were introduced into ZSM-5 through an ion-exchange method to change acid site distribution of ZSM-5. The introduction of Co cations significantly improved DCE conversion and VCM selectivity, achieving 6 and 2-fold greater than bare HZSM-5, respectively. Postmortem analyses allowed us to delineate the role of acid sites: Lewis acid sites are the major active sites, whereas Brønsted acid sites give rise to undesired secondary reactions. Thus, our results demonstrate that the introduction of Co cations increases the number of relevant active sites, and simultaneously eliminates undesirable sites. These findings help understand the effect of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in zeolites on the DCE dehydrochlorination, providing useful information for designing rational catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Anomalous chloride extraction from water to 1,2-dichloroethane is detected by cyclic voltammetry and evaluated by the potential step amperometry of the background electrolyte combined with the open circuit potential measurements. The extraction process is affected by the composition of the organic phase. In the present study, the latter effect is elucidated and the mechanism of the solvent extraction of chloride is proposed. The mechanism couples the energetically unfavourable extraction of a hydrophobic salt (e.g., tetrapentylammonium tetraphenylborate, bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetraphenylborate) from the organic to the aqueous phase with the favourable extraction of the chloride salt of the present hydrophobic cation in the opposite direction resulting in the chloride accumulation in the organic solvent phase. An evaluation and analysis of the ion flux suggests that the chloride anions are extracted to the organic phase in the form of the free anions and the anions bound to the ion-pairs, and for the most part as the hydrated salt clusters, the formation of which is likely to be the driving force of the extraction process. The transfer of the accumulated chloride anion back to the aqueous phase is responsible for the positive current shift of the cyclic voltammogram and the steady-state positive current recorded in the potential step amperometric measurements. First application of the novel potentiostatic assembly introducing the polarizable reference electrode for the organic solvent phase is demonstrated.",

In this work, the optical properties of alternating π-conjugated copolymers based on phenylene–bithiophene were investigated. It was found that the alternating 3,3′-dihexylbithiophene and tetrafluorophenylene structure was the primary one in the highly crystalline polymer film, while the other bithiophene–phenylene alternating copolymers did produce crystalline films. The number of fluorine atoms on the phenylene unit critically affected the film crystallinity; this could be attributed to the rigidity of the π-structure based on intramolecular H–F and S–F interactions. The crystalline polymer films demonstrated efficient red-emission. A red-shift of the emission band (+∼150 nm) and a twofold increase of the quantum yield for films compared with the 1,2-dichloroethane solution state were observed. This is likely due to crystallization-induced enhanced emission by the π-conjugated polymers. Additionally, significant tuning of the light-emission (from yellow, orange to red-colored emission) of the films was realized by controlling the crystallinity. The casting solvents and annealing treatment for film formation strongly affected the macrostructure (crystalline domain).

Here, the adsorption of single‐wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at the water/1,2‐dichloroethane (DCE) interface, and the subsequent investigation of the influence of the adsorbed nanotube layer on interfacial ion transfer, is studied by using the voltammetric transfer of tetramethylammonium (TMA+) and hexafluorophosphate (PF6 −) as probe ions. The presence of the interfacial SWCNT layer significantly suppresses the transfer of both ions across the interface, with a greater degree of selectivity towards the PF6 − ion. This effect was attributed both to the partial blocking of the interface by the SWCNTs and to the potential dependant adsorption of background electrolyte ions on the surface of the SWCNTs, as confirmed by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which is caused by an electrostatic interaction between the interfacial SWCNTs and the transferring ion.",

To uncover 1,2-DCE-induced neurotoxicity in cerebellar granular cells (CGCs), and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we explored this, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings showed significant cell viability inhibition in human CGCs (HCGCs) treated with 1,2-DCE. Flow cytometry and mitochondrial membrane potential analyses discovered an increase in apoptotic-mediated cell death in HCGCs after 1,2-DCE treatment. This HCGC apoptosis was involved in the increases of protein expression in Cytochrome c, Caspase-3, Bad, Bim, transformation related protein 53, Caspase-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and Survivin. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blot confirmed the increases in Cytochrome c, Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-3, and Bad in HCGCs after 1,2-DCE treatment. Bax inhibitor peptide V5 rescued 1,2-DCE-induced HCGC apoptosis. Furthermore, 80 CD-1 male mice were exposed to 1,2-DCE by inhalation at 0, 100, 350, and 700 mg/m3 for 6 h/day for 4 weeks. An open field test found abnormal neurobehavioral changes in the mice exposed to 1,2-DCE. Histopathological examination showed significantly shrunken and hypereosinophilic cytoplasm with nuclear pyknosis in mouse CGCs from the 700 mg/m3 1,2-DCE group. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay verified significant increases in apoptotic positive cells in the mouse CGCs after 1,2-DCE exposure. We confirmed the increases in the expressions of Cytochrome c, Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-3 and Bad in the mice exposed to 1,2-DCE.

Mice were randomly divided into five groups: the control group, the 1,2-DCE poisoned group, and the low-, medium- and high-dose diallyl sulfide (DAS) intervention groups. The present study found that CYP2E1 expression levels in the brains of the 1,2-DCE-poisoned group were upregulated transcriptionally; in contrast, the levels were suppressed by DAS pretreatment in the intervention groups. In addition, the expression levels of both Nrf2 and HO-1 were also upregulated transcriptionally in the brains of the 1,2-DCE-poisoned group, while they were suppressed dose-dependently in the intervention groups. Moreover, compared with the control group, MDA levels and water contents in the brains of the 1,2-DCE-poisoned group increased, whereas NPSH levels and tight junction (TJ) protein levels decreased significantly. Conversely, compared with the 1,2-DCE- poisoned group, MDA levels and water contents in the brains of the intervention groups decreased, and NPSH levels and TJ protein levels increased significantly. Furthermore, pathological changes of brain edema observed in the 1,2-DCE-poisoned group were markedly improved in the intervention groups. Collectively, our results suggested that CYP2E1 expression could be transcriptionally upregulated in 1,2-DCE-poisoned mice, which might enhance 1,2-DCE metabolism in vivo, and induce oxidative damage and TJ disruption in the brain, ultimately leading to brain edema.",

Identification and quantitative determination of Sertindole using Gas Chromatography - Mass spectroscopy method in samples obtained after purification of the extracts from the biological material (liver) by solid-phase extraction. Methods. Sertindole was isolated from the biological material by the mixture of Acetonitrile - Perchloric acid 70% (1:1) with the following liquid extraction by 1,2-Dichloroethane (рН 11). The extracts after purification using the SPE Oasis HLB 30 mg (Waters, USA) cartridges were eluted by Ethanol 96%, evaporated to dryness under Nitrogen flow, and then the residues were dissolved in 250 μl of Methanol. Identification and assay of Sertindole in the solutions and the model samples were carried out using Agilent 6890N chromatograph equipped by 5978B Mass detector (Agilent Technology, USA), RTX-5 column was used, 30m×0,25mm, 0,25 μm (Restek, USA). Temperature gradient: 50 °С (0,5 min), 25 °С/min till 150 °С, and then the temperature rise was 10 °С/min until 320 °С was reached. Isothermal mode was set at 320 °С (30 min).

Monitoring and control of priority chemicals presented in the emissions in cities of Lipetsk, Omsk, Cherepovets, Novokuznetsk, participating in «The Clean Air» Federal project, require frequent sampling of air samples, their transportation and storage prior to analysis. Since most samples are not analyzed immediately after sampling, correct quantitative results can only be obtained if there is verified data on the long-term stability of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) collected on sorption tubes. The purpose of this work is to obtain up-to-date, experimentally substantiated data on the stability of various VOCs during storage of exposed sorption tubes in laboratory conditions. Materials and methods. Several groups of VOCs have been selected as the most common air pollutants. VOC stability tests during storage up to 5 months were carried out on model samples using sorption tubes filled with Tenax TA sorbent. The VOC content was determined by thermal desorption (TD) and gas chromatographic analysis using mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS). Results. When stored under laboratory conditions at a temperature of (20 ± 5)°C and humidity in the range of 33-65% in hermetically sealed containers or a glass desiccator, there was shown the stability of 28 VOCs, taken on tubes filled with Tenax TA sorbent: trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, trichlorethylene, tetrachlorethylene, benzene, o-xylene, the sum of isomers of m-xylene and p-xylene, ethylbenzene, n-octane, toluene, n-butanol, n-heptane, 1,2-dichloroethane, n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, chlorobenzene, isopropylbenzene, α-pinene, n-propylbenzene, α-methylstyrene, 2-butoxyethanol, styrene up to 5 months; for 5 VOCs: phenol, pentanal (valeric aldehyde), hexanal (caproic aldehyde), n-nonane and n-decane - no more than 4 weeks. Limitations. The stability of the investigated VOCs was not studied at low (less than 15 °C) and high (more than 25 °C) temperatures, as well as high humidity (more than 65 %). Conclusion.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Separating trivalent f-block elements remains a central challenge due to their similar ionic radii and chemical behaviors. Historically, these separations have been achieved using single extractants, either alone or in combination with ion exchange chromatography. However, recent studies, including this work, have explored the potential of using synergic combinations of multiple extractants to enhance extraction and separation efficiencies for trivalent actinide separations. This study investigated synergic solvent extraction (SX) systems for extracting and separating americium and curium using three neutral organophosphorus ligands: octyl (phenyl)-N,N-diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine (CMPO), dibutyl N,N-diethylcarbamylmethylenephosphonate (DBDECMP), and dihexyl N,N-diethylcarbamylmethylenephosphonate (DHDECMP), combined with either 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA, pKa = 6.25) or 4-benzoyl-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (HP, pKa = 3.95). Distribution ratios (D) were determined for 241Am3+ and 242Cm3+ as functions of nitric acid pH using 1,2-dichloroethane as the solvent. The combination of these ligands resulted in varying degrees of synergy as demonstrated by their synergic extraction enhancement coefficients (SEC). A maximum separation factor (SFAm/Cm) of 2.65 ± 0.21 was achieved with 0.05 M HTTA and 0.05 M DBDECMP at pH 2.50. This extractant combination was impregnated into an inert macroporous support at various ligand ratios using rotary evaporator methods to produce novel extraction chromatographic (EXC) resins. Various parameters affecting the adsorption of 241Am3+ and 242Cm3+ onto EXC resins, such as solution pH, ionic strength, contact time, γ-irradiation dose, and temperature, were studied. Metal extraction and synergism were retained upon conversion to EXC resins, with increasing extraction observed at higher pH levels. Thermodynamic studies showed increased adsorption and decreased Gibbs free energy (ΔG) with rising temperature. Kinetic investigations indicated rapid and consistent uptake after 10 minutes. The EXC resins exhibited excellent metal retention in preliminary column experiments, demonstrating a promising potential to separate americium and curium with a maximum decontamination factor of 88. Overall, this work successfully demonstrated the identification and conversion of synergic SX systems into novel synergic EXC resins for adjacent trivalent actinide separations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. The chemical compound 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), or ethylene dichloride, is an industrial very short-lived substance (VSLS) whose major use is as a feedstock in the production chain of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Like other chlorinated VSLSs, transport of DCE (and/or its atmospheric oxidation products) to the stratosphere could contribute to ozone depletion there. However, despite annual production volumes greatly exceeding those of more prominent VSLSs (e.g. dichloromethane), global DCE observations are sparse; thus, the magnitude and distribution of DCE emissions and trends in its atmospheric abundance are poorly known. In this study, we performed an exploratory analysis of the global DCE budget between 2002 and 2020. Combining bottom-up data on annual production and assumptions around fugitive losses during production and feedstock use, we assessed the DCE source strength required to reproduce atmospheric DCE observations. We show that the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT 3-D chemical transport model (CTM) reproduces DCE measurements from various aircraft missions well, including HIPPO (2009–2011), ATom (2016–2018), and KORUS-AQ (2016), along with surface measurements from Southeast Asia, when assuming a regionally varying production emission factor in the range of 0.5 %–1.5 %. Our findings imply substantial fugitive losses of DCE and/or substantial emissive applications (e.g. solvent use) that are poorly reported. We estimate that DCE's global source increased by ∼ 45 % between 2002 (349 ± 61 Gg yr−1) and 2020 (505 ± 90 Gg yr−1), with its contribution to stratospheric chlorine increasing from 8.2 (± 1.5) to ∼ 12.9 (± 2.4) ppt Cl (where ppt denotes parts per trillion) over this period. DCE's relatively short overall tropospheric lifetime (∼ 83 d) limits, although does not preclude, its transport to the stratosphere, and we show that its impact on ozone is small at present. Annually averaged, DCE is estimated to have decreased ozone in the lower stratosphere by up to several parts per billion (< 1 %) in 2020, although a larger effect in the springtime Southern Hemisphere polar lower stratosphere is apparent (decreases of up to ∼ 1.3 %). Given strong potential for growth in DCE production tied to demand for PVC, ongoing measurements would be of benefit to monitor potential future increases in its atmospheric abundance and its contribution to ozone depletion.\n",

The stable and reproducible photocurrents that reached more than 1.2 mA/cm 2 were attained at standard conditions. Then, the substoichiometric titanium oxide has been re-placed by the nanoneedles of WO 3 containing more than bare one, oxygen deficiencies. Further, change in its crystal lattice system allowed better stabilization of the overall working system and higher rate of solar energy conversion to CO 2 reduction products. The mechanism which has been pointed as responsible for better charge separation in the junction relied onto indirect charge transfer between components and could be diversified by the content of carbon in the upper layer. Design, construction and performance of those systems will be an objective of this presentation. Generation of H 2 using metallocenes and their derivatives as electron donors has been studied since the late 1980s. Three decades later it has been shown that light driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) also occurs at polarized liquid|liquid interface with sacrificial electron donor. We will demonstrate light driven (HER) at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES), namely 1,2-dichloroethane|water (DCE|W) interface using photoexcited decamethylruthenocene (DMRc) as electron donor using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) setup. In particular in our sytem DMRc is in situ regenerated by electroreduction of its oxidized form (DMRc + ) formed during HER as a by-product, at the electrode positioned close to DCE|W. This reaction is followed by anion insertion from water to organic phase. Such regeneration enables continuous hydrogen generation using small amount of DMRc. Proton transfer from the acidic aqueous phase to the DCE phase is ensured by negative chemical polarization of the liquid|liquid interface. The reduction of protons in DCE occurs only after excitation of DMRc by light. Most importantly significant flux of hydrogen is detected only when SECM tip is positioned in front of the electrode, where DMRc is regenerated. Our group has presented a new extremely fast, efficient and also low-cost growth method of ZnO NRs [2], based on the hydro-thermal method. This fully reproducible method allows growth of nanorods without any catalyst or complexing agent on various substrates (silicon, GaAs, quartz, sapphire), as shown in Fig. 1. These NRs were successfully used in construction of simple PV cells with efficiency of 14%. What is important, all technologies used in this approach are very inexpensive and easy scalable to industrial size. Our group has also attempted to develop a technology for the growth of CuO layers by hydrothermal method by the similar approach as for ZnO NRs. The first results are very promising. We managed to obtain homogeneous layers with controlled thickness. In the next stage, attempts will be made to optimize the electrical parameters of the layers, and then a prototype photovoltaic cell will be constructed. excellent candidate for novel photovoltaic materials with unique combination of properties, the potential for low cost and easy processing along with relatively high power conversion efficiencies. 2 Nota-bly, the optoelectronic properties and the influence on the photovoltaic parameters of perovskite materials are highly sensitive to the adopted synthetic strategy. Therefore, it is of great interest to provide simple and feasible approaches to high quality hybrid perovskites and the respective thin films. In that context, the synthetic approach induced by mechanical forces has appeared as a new emerging methodology in materials science. The mechanochemical reactions in solid state offer a significant advance by avoiding the use of solvents, dramatically shortening synthesis times and simultaneously increasing the purity and amount of product. Herein, we have developed a facile mechanochemical route for the preparation of various organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites and lead-free perovskite materials for high-efficiency thin-film photovoltaics. 3 Strikingly, this procedure can pave the way for new compositions and phases, which are not otherwise obtainable. 4 The mechanochemical approach for preparation of perovskite materials has also advantage over a solution-based synthetic routes in terms of hysteresis and device performance. 5 Our studies highlight the essential need for atomic-level characterization of photovoltaic perovskite materials and provided fundamental understanding of photovoltaic parameters in these systems and their superior stability. A major bottleneck in the fabrication of efficient bio-organic nanoelectronic devices resides in the strong charge recombination that is present at the different interfaces forming the complex system. An efficient way to overcome this limitation is to add an optimized self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of molecules between the biological material and the electrode that promotes an efficient direct electron transfer whilst minimising wasteful processes of charge recombination. Another approach is to include plasmonic nano-architectures that interact with photoactive components often leading to an improved photocurrent density obtained from biophotoelectrodes. Here we show that coupling extremophilic robust photosystem I (PSI) reaction centers 1 with plasmonically active silver island film (SIF) leads to enhancement of both fluorescence intensity as well as photocurrent generation. The nanostructure is assembled by the controlled attachment of PSI to a monolayer graphene deposited on the SIF layer, using cytochrome c 553 as the conductive orienting biomolecule 2-4 . The molecular organic interface between PSI and electrode surface is based on a pyrene-nitrilotriacetic acid SAM containing various metallic redox centers for oriented coupling of the biophotoactive layer of PSI. A combination of theoretical calculations, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and photoelectrochemical characterization reveals that the metal center at the or-19 Phys. Chem.

The results prove that control of the nanoscale spatial arrangement of components and implementa-tion of plasmonically active metallic nanostructures are crucial for improving performance of PSI - based photoelectrodes for energy conversion. The specific conjugation of cyt c 553 with the Ni - NTA - pyrene/SLG - /FTO electrode was performed using the molecular interaction between the donor (P700) side of the PSI and cyt c 553 (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows the SEM image of cross-sectional area of the PSI/cyt c 553 / Ni-NTA-pyrene/SLG-/FTO electrode , including the 3D organization of the PSI/cyt c 553 on the electrode surface. The structure and function of photosynthetic machinery have been well - studied throughout recent decades. However, regulation of this machinery is complex and new players are still being revealed. Photosynthetic organisms possess, among other protection mechanisms, an extensive network of auxiliary electron transport pathways to regulate photosynthesis. On the one hand, these routes can be considered necessary for the survival of cells under extreme changes in environmental conditions, whereas on the other hand, the resulting physiological changes can be thought of as a “waste” of photosynthetic electrons or reducing power. Our research is focused on auxiliary electron transport pathways, particularly on flavodiiron proteins (FDPs or Flv) in cyanobacteria and algae ( e.g . Allahverdiyeva et al 2013, Ermakova et al. 2014, Mustila et al. 2016, Jokel et al. 2018, Sanchez et al. 2019). FDPs function as powerful electron sink by photo-reducing O 2 in the Mehler-like reaction downstream of Photosystem I. The FDP pathway(s) is important to consider in future high-yield crop development and design living factories producing targeted end-chemicals. Our applied photosynthesis research aims to optimize photosynthetic performance for improved chemical and bioenergy production, as well as waste-water treatment. We have developed a novel proto-col for improved H 2 photoproduction yields in C. reinhardtii under periodic light conditions, which does not require severe stress conditions (Kosourov et al. 2018). This study has clearly shown that a major ob-stacle to efficient H 2 photoproduction is a strong competition between two metabolic pathways: CO 2 fixa-tion leading to the biomass accumulation and the hydrogenase enzyme catalysing photoproduction of H 2 . This finding opens up new opportunities for construction of highly-efficient cell factor",

However, plastic pyrolysis oil contains various components that require stringent removal before subsequent processes. In particular, Cl compounds originating from the decomposition of poly(vinyl chloride) can cause serious corrosion of reactors and catalyst deactivation in downstream processes. While extensive research has been conducted on the removal of other heteroatoms (S, N, and O) from organic compounds via hydrotreating, studies on the removal of Cl have been scarce. In this study, hydrodechlorination over Pt catalysts on various supports is comprehensively investigated using 1,2-dichloroethane as a model reactant. Our results demonstrate that Pt on γ-Al2O3 can exhibit exceptionally high catalytic activity compared to those on other supports due to a distinct bifunctional mechanism. Rigorous studies reveal that the Lewis acidic pentacoordinated Al sites of γ-Al2O3 activate C-Cl bonds, whereas Pt activates H2 and provides spillover H to remove Cl as HCl. The bifunctional mechanism enables the minimized use of precious Pt (<0.1 wt %) to achieve high activity.

Silica chloride catalyst was used to speed up the reaction in one of the syntheses and in each synthesis, Thin Layer Chromatography was used to monitor the progress of the reaction. The time taken by each reaction and the yield were used as the basis for determining the solvent action and the reducing efficiency.  \nPlace and Duration of Study: M.Sc. Access controlled Teaching Laboratory, School of Chemistry, Newcastle University, New castle upon Tyne, United Kingdom from June to August 2012. \nMethodology: Reductive amination was carried out by reacting 4-tert-butylbenzaldehyde and 4-tert-butylbenzylamine, using the direct and then the indirect approaches. This was followed by methylation using the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction in each of the two approaches. The time taken by each reaction was monitored and the product of each approach was characterised by EIS-MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FTIR. \nResults: 1,2-dichloroethane gave the best solvent action at 40°C (Yield: 75%) and NaBH4  gave the best-reducing action with silica chloride catalyst at 25°C (Yield: 50%). At the end of each synthesis,  in all obtained  products, 1H NMR spectrum gave a single peak of 18 hydrogen atoms at 1.3 -1.5 ppm for the existence of 6 methyl groups in the two tertiary-butyl substituents, the 13C NMR spectrum also showed a peak at  31-32 ppm for the six methyl carbon atoms in the two tertiary-butyl substituents, the FTIR spectrum showed  a strong band at  2460 cm-1 for the presence of a tertiary ammonium ion and finally the EIS-MS gave  a mass to charge ratio of 324.2693 as a confirmation of the relative molecular mass of the compound. \nConclusion:  The target compound can be synthesised by both direct and the indirect approaches of reductive amination in any of the solvents tested with/without a catalyst at room or elevated temperature using NaBH4 or STAB as a reducing agent but the best solvent action can be achieved with DCE at 40°C and the best-reducing action can be achieved with NaBH4 in the presence of silica chloride.",

Heavy metal ions are commonly present as co-contaminants in various organohalide-contaminated sites. To understand the impacts of heavy metal ions on the environmental fate of organohalides, we investigated the effects of Zn2+, Cu2+ and Cd2+ on reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) in sediment microcosms and transferred enrichment cultures. PCE and 1,2-DCA-dechlorinating enrichment cultures could be consecutively transferred in the presence of up to 10 mg/L Cu2+ or 10 mg/L Zn2+; by comparison, up to 50 mg/L Cd2+ had minor impacts on the microbial reductive dechlorination of PCE and 1,2-DCA. The inhibitory effects of tested heavy metal ions on microbial reductive dechlorination ranked in descending order are Zn2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+. Community profiling and principal component analysis indicate that the concentration and type of contaminants (e.g., heavy metal ions, organohalides) shaped the microbial community structure, an observation similar to a prior report. The enrichment of certain organohalide-respring bacteria (e.g., Dehalococcoides, Dehalogenimonas) during continuous transfers exposed to heavy metal ions suggests that they are capable of tolerating high concentrations of heavy metal ions.

In this study, we comprehensively compared catalytic behaviors of PRM and THM when individually expressed in the heterologous host, Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2-155. Kinetic results revealed a half-saturation coefficient (Km) of 53.0 ± 13.1 mg/L for PRM, nearly four times lower than that of THM (235.8 ± 61.6 mg/L), suggesting PRM has a higher affinity to dioxane.

    "abstract": "1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) is a typical organic chlorinated compound largely utilized in chemical manufacturing and industrial production and also a common pollutant in organically contaminated sites. The adsorption of 1,2-DCA on soil grains significantly influences its environmental fate and removal process. This study investigated the influence of fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) on the adsorption–desorption of 1,2-DCA in solid–liquid interfaces in water or constructed porous media. Experimental findings demonstrated the influence of organic matter on the adsorption of 1,2-DCA at the solid–water interface. 1,2-DCA adsorption increased in the FA or HA-treated soils when organic matter was present on the solid surfaces. The 1,2-DCA adsorption in the mixture of FA and HA was slightly lower than that in single organic acids, depending on the binding of FA and HA to the soil grains/colloids. Basic conditions reduced the adsorption of 1,2-DCA on soils, whereas acidic conditions enhanced adsorption due to the increased interactions via adsorption sites and hydrogen bonds. Conversely, the presence of organic matter in solutions (liquid phase in constructed porous media) will reduce the adsorption of 1,2-DCA on solid surfaces and increase the transport in the model aquifer. The combination of FA, HA, and rhamnolipids is helpful for the removal of 1,2-DCA from solid surfaces. Additionally, because of the enhanced desorption, the risk of 1,2-DCA contamination in groundwater can be increased when the organic matter or surfactant is present in the liquid phase if the eluent is not collected. This study helps to better understand the cooperative interaction of soil organic matter and chlorinated hydrocarbons at solid–water interfaces and the environmental fate and potential removal strategies of chlorinated hydrocarbons in contaminated sites.",

In this study, the extraction reaction of Pd(II) in chloride media using of N, N, N’, N’, N”, N”-hexaoctyl-nitrilotriacetamide (NTAamide(C8)) as a novel extractant has been demonstrated. Three diluents with high dielectric constants (acetophenone (AP), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and 1-octanol (OC)) were used for the solvent extraction reaction. The slope analysis indicated that the anion exchange extraction reaction of Pd(II) was consistent with an approximately 2:1 stoichiometry for the NTAamide(C8)/AP and NTAamide(C8)/DCE systems, and 1:1 for NTAamide(C8)/OC. Moreover, the ED behavior of the extracted Pd(II) complex was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Palladium reduction was found to be an irreversible process based on analysis of the standard rate constant. A semi-integral analysis of the voltammogram determined the diffusion coefficients of the extracted Pd(II) complex in the AP, DCE, and OC systems to be 3.7 ± 0.1 × 10−10, 2.8 ± 0.1 × 10−10 and 1.5 ± 0.2 × 10−10 m2 s−1, respectively. Furthermore, consecutive extraction-electrodeposition processes using the NTAamide(C8)/AP system were carried out for five cycles. High extraction percentage (E > 91%) and current efficiency (ε > 83.1%) were attained in all cycles. The electrodeposits recovered from the extraction-electrodeposition process were identified as Pd metal through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses.",

It was found that PTB7 main chains presented amorphous conformations induced by the poor solvent 1,2-dichloroethane. However, the local ordered aggregation appeared in amorphous conformations when the solubility of the poor solvent was again lowered by reducing temperature. It is worth noting that the size of ordered aggregation was further increased with the decrease of solution concentration or increase of external force. It was found that there were two main PTB7 absorption peaks in the UV-vis absorption spectra; we denoted A0 -0 for the intensity of the lower energy absorption peak and A0-1 for the intensity of the higher energy absorption peak. The ratio R = A0-0/ A0-1 was used to characterize the dynamic evolution from disorder to order of the PTB7 condensed state structures in absorption spectra. It increased from 0.94 for PTB7 amorphous state to 1.25 for PTB7 large-size ordered aggregation. The dynamic evolution from chain disorder to order could also be distinctly observed by TEM. It was inferred that PTB7 condensed state structures (amorphous state, local ordered aggregation, and large-scale ordered aggregation) might exist simultaneously because of the complexity of copolymer conformations.

The Tc continuously decreases depending on the content of DCE, which eventually disappears with the complete evacuation of DCE, affording solvent‐free compound 1 with the N‐state in the entire temperature range (this behavior is reversible).

When the cathode was applied as the sole electron donor for dechlorination, columbic efficiencies reached the values greater than 80%. Tetrachloroethylene dechlorination showed a metabolic pathway with cis-1,2-dichloroethene as the main product, whereas 1,2-dichloroethane was dechlorinated entirely to the nontoxic ethene. The cathodic biofilms were highly abundant with the dechlorination and electro-active genera, while significant bacterial consortium variation was observed in response to the different VCH types and changes in cathodic potential. Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Lactococcus were mostly enriched for tetrachloroethylene dechlorination, and pceA, tceA and omcX were highly expressed.

    "abstract": "Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an atomically thin semiconducting material with a direct band gap. This physical property is attributable to atomically thin optical devices such as sensors, light-emitting devices, and photovoltaic cells. Recently, a near-unity photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of a monolayer MoS2 was demonstrated via a treatment with a molecular acid, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (TFSI); however, the mechanism still remains a mystery. Here, we work on PL enhancement of monolayer MoS2 by treatment of Brønsted acids (TFSI and sulfuric acid (H2SO4)) to identify the importance of the protonated environment. In TFSI as an acid, different solvents-1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), acetonitrile, and water-were studied, as they show quite different acidity in solution. All of the solvents showed PL enhancement, and the highest was observed in DCE. This behavior in DCE would be due to the higher acidity than others have. Acids from different anions can also be studied in water as a common solvent. Both TFSI and H2SO4 showed similar PL enhancement (∼4-8 enhancement) at the same proton concentration, indicating that the proton is a key factor to enhance the PL intensity. Finally, we considered another cation, Li+ from Li2SO4, instead of H2SO4, in water. Although Li and H atoms showed similar binding energy on MoS2 from theoretical calculations, Li2SO4 treatment showed little PL enhancement; only coexisting H2SO4 reproduced the enhancement. This study demonstrated the importance of a protonated environment to increase the PL intensity of monolayer MoS2.

    "abstract": "Ethylene dichloride (EDC) or 1,2 dichloroethane (C2H4Cl2) is used in industry as a raw material for vinyl chloride monomers (VCM) and intermediates in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production. Besides, the EDC is also used in TEL components, which are mixed in an anti-knock mixture; solvents for oils, waxes, and coating removers (coat cleaners); and raw materials for diamine ethylene, perchlorate ethylene, carbon tetrachloride, and trichloroethylene. The EDC needs in the world have increased since 1985 with the increasing demand for vinyl chloride and polyvinyl chloride. Based on the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics data until the end of 2005, Indonesia exports EDC from producing countries such as the USA, Japan, and European countries. Therefore, to meet the lack of domestic EDC requirements, the establishment of the EDC plant was considered. Ethylene dichloride can be produced from ethylene and chlorine. Ethylene can be obtained from Candra Asri Plant in Cilegon and chlorine obtained from Sulfindo Adi Venture Plant. Based on domestic and foreign EDC requirements consideration, existing plant capacity, availability of raw materials, and range capacity for EDC plants is between 9,000-46,000 (Faith and Keyes, 1957). It is the design of this EDC plant with a size of 40,000 tons/year. Based on a review of low operating conditions (temperature and pressure) and the factory presence previously made, the Ethylene dichloride (EDC) plant is classified as low risk. Economic evaluation calculations result in the show: 1) Percentage of Return of Investments (ROI) before tax of 35; 2) Pay Out Time (POT) before tax is 2.24 years; 3) Break-Even Point (BEP) is 41.35%; 4) Shut Down Point (SDP) of 21.7%; 5) Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) of 25.56%. The bank's interest rate in 2018 was 8%, so the DCF was more significant than the bank's loan interest rate. This results based on Aries and Newton's (1955) economics criteria, which concluded that the EDC plant establishment is low-risk.

Tris(acetylacetonato)aluminium (Al(acac)3) exhibited identical spectral features in various solvents, reflecting its rigid and symmetric octahedral structure. In contrast, an Al-salen complex displayed pronounced solvent-dependent spectral variations corresponding to coordination number changes induced by Lewis base coordination. In non-coordinating solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane, the Al-salen complex retained a pentacoordinate structure, whereas coordination of strongly donating solvents such as DMSO led to the formation of a hexacoordinate species, accompanied by a high-energy shift in the absorption edge. Notably, these structural and electronic changes were detected by XAS, highlighting the superior sensitivity of Al K-edge XAS to local electronic environments.

    "abstract": "In the present work, the removal of NaCl using the present type of supported liquid membrane technique has been investigated. A simple apparatus devised and constructed was used to conduct the experiments. Various factors that would affect the progress of transport were studied and these were initial concentration (C i) of simulated seawater in donor phase (DP), presence of mobile carrier (MC) in the liquid membrane (LM), concentration of MC in LM, presence of sequestering agent (SA) in the receptor phase (RP), and speed of stirring. The volume ratio of DP to RP was kept constant at 2:1. Type (1,2 dichloroethane (DCE)) and thickness (2 mm) of LM were kept constant. Cellophane constituted the support for the LM. The most important findings emphasized the importance of the presence of a MC in the LM to enhance mass transfer through the LM and that an optimum concentration of MC existed. Also the importance of stirring in promoting mass transfer by minimizing the boundary layer intact to the cellophane support was elucidated. The best conditions arrived at were MC = 0.0538 mol/l (mol of dibenzo-18-crown-6/l of LM), SA = 0.0617 mol/l (mol of soluble starch/l of RP), slow stirring (100 rpm) of DP, and using DCE as LM. The mass transfer of NaCl was analyzed based on kinetic laws of two consecutive irreversible first-order reactions, and kinetic parameters (k 1d, k 2m, k 2r, R m max , t max, J d max , J r max ) for the transport of NaCl were investigated. The values obtained demonstrate that the process is diffusion-controlled. Results indicate that the membrane entrance and exit rate constants (k 1, k 2) increase directly with C i and inversely with quantity of SA.",

Understanding the intricate processes involved in the evaporation and dissolution of sessile droplets is of paramount importance for applications such as inkjet printing, surface coating, and nanoparticle deposition, etc. In this study, we present a demonstration of electrochemical investigation of the dissolution behaviour in sub-nL droplets down to sub-pL volume. Droplets on an electrode have been studied for decades in the field of electrochemistry to understand the phase transfer of ions at the oil–water interface, accelerated reaction rates in microdroplets, etc. However, the impact of microdroplet dissolution on the redox activity of confined molecules within the droplet has not been explored previously. As a proof-of-principle, we examine the dissolution kinetics of 1,2-dichloroethane droplets (DCE) spiked with 155 μM decamethylferrocene within an aqueous phase on an ultramicroelectrode (r = 6.3 μm). The aqueous phase serves as an infinite sink, enabling the dissolution of DCE droplets while also facilitating convenient electrical contact with the reference/counter electrode (Ag/AgCl 1 M KCl). Through comprehensive voltammetric analysis, we unravel the impact of droplet dissolution on electrochemical response as the droplet reaches minuscule volumes. We validate our experimental findings by finite element modelling, which shows deviations from the experimental results as the droplet accesses negligible volumes, suggesting the presence of complex dissolution modes.",

Currently, no dynamic process models to study the process behavior or to develop optimal trajectories for the 1,2-dichloroethane production under different demand response scenarios are available. Hence, we formulate and solve a dynamic, pressure-driven model of the synthesis of 1,2-dichloroethane and validate it with real process data in this contribution.

It is indicated in the treatment of serious, simple or mixed bacterial infections, and its administration in continuous or intermittent infusion allows optimization of the concentration of antibiotic to keep it above the minimum inhibitory concentration. We developed and validated a chromatographic method by ultra‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry to measure ceftazidime concentration in human plasma. Following extraction with acetonitrile and 1,2‐dichloroethane, the chromatographic separation was achieved using an Acquity ® UPLC ® BEHTM (2.1 × 100 mm i.d., 1.7 µm) reverse‐phase C18 column, with a water–acetonitrile linear gradient containing 0.1% formic acid at a 0.4 mL/min flow rate. Ceftazidime and its internal standard (cefotaxime) were detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode using mass‐to‐charge transitions of 547.0 → 467.9/396.1 and 456.0 → 395.8/324.1, respectively.

    "abstract": "Soil microbial communities are essential for the natural attenuation of organic pollutants, yet their ecological responses under long-term contamination remain insufficiently understood. This study examined the bacterial community structure and the abundance of dechlorinating bacteria at a decommissioned pharmaceutical-chemical site in northern Jiangsu Province, China, where the primary pollutants were dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and toluene. Eighteen soil samples from the surface (0.2 m) and deep (2.2 m) layers were collected using a Geoprobe-7822DT system and analyzed for physicochemical properties and microbial composition via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The results showed that the bacterial community composition was significantly shaped by the soil pH, moisture content, pollutant type, and depth. Dechlorinating bacteria were detected at all sites but exhibited low relative abundance, with higher concentrations in the surface soils. Desulfuromonas, Desulfitobacterium, and Desulfovibrio were the dominant dechlorinators, while Dehalococcoides appeared only in the deep soils. A network analysis revealed positive correlations between the dechlorinators and BTEX-degrading and fermentative taxa, indicating potential cooperative interactions in pollutant degradation. However, the low abundance of dechlorinators suggests that the intrinsic bioremediation capacity is limited. These findings provide new insights into microbial ecology under complex organic pollution, and support the need for integrated remediation strategies that enhance microbial functional potential in legacy-contaminated soils.",

The gelation properties of compound 1 were comprehensively evaluated, revealing its ability to immobilize 1,2-dichloroethane and n-butanol, while other solvents tested did not form gels. A series of analyses, including SEM, FTIR, 1H NMR, and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, were conducted to investigate the characteristics of the resulting organogels. The findings indicated that the gelator self-assembled into a three-dimensional supramolecular network, driven by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. As anticipated, the organogels displayed multiple stimuli-responsive sol–gel transitions in response to changes in chemical redox conditions, heating, and the presence of anions due to the dynamic and reversible nature of the non-covalent interactions. Notably, the gelators interacted with various electron acceptor molecules, resulting in the formation of charge transfer (CT) complexes and binary organogels, accompanied by noticeable color changes. Additionally, the gels proved to be effective absorbents, suggesting potential applications for the removal of Rhodamine B cationic dyes from water. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",

    "abstract": "1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCE), a common industrial organic solvent, enters humans primarily via inhalation, damaging the central nervous system and organs like the liver and kidneys. However, its cardiotoxicity and the multi-organ developmental toxicity in zebrafish remain unclear. This study investigated its cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity using a zebrafish model. Zebrafish embryos at 4 h after fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 0, 200, 400, or 800 μg/mL 1,2-DCE until 120 hpf, and morphological and genetic changes were assessed. As the dosage of 1,2-DCE increases, the mortality rates of zebrafish also increase (p < 0.05), and the LC50 was determined as 867.5 μg/mL. Exposure to 1,2-DCE significantly increased pericardial area, heart rate, and sinus venosus-bulbus arteriosus (SV-BA) distance, upregulated nkx2.5 and gata4, and downregulated bmp4, cmlc1, vmhc, and spaw (p < 0.05). In the exposure groups, hepatic vacuolation and atrophy were observed, accompanied by downregulated cyp1a (p < 0.05). Renal tubule length decreased dose-dependently, with downregulation of pax2a, pax8, wt1a, wt1b, and nphsl (p < 0.05) in the exposure group. These data demonstrate that 1,2-DCE induces multi-organ toxicity in zebrafish, causing structural and functional impairments in the heart, liver, and kidney. This suggests that the harmful effects of 1,2-DCE on zebrafish should be taken into account when evaluating environmental risks in the future.",

    "abstract": "The catalytic utilization of chlorine-organic wastes remains of extreme importance from an ecological point of view. Depending on the molecular structure of the chlorine-substituted hydrocarbon (presence of unsaturated bonds, intermolecular chlorine-to-hydrogen ratio), the features of its catalytic decomposition can be significantly different. Often, 1,2-dichloroethane is used as a model substrate. In the present work, the catalytic decomposition of trichloroethylene (C2HCl3) over microdispersed 100Ni and 96Ni-4W with the formation of carbon nanofibers (CNF) was studied. Catalysts were obtained by a co-precipitation of complex salts followed by reductive thermolysis. The disintegration of the initial bulk alloy driven by its interaction with the reaction mixture C2HCl3/H2/Ar entails the formation of submicron active particles. It has been established that the optimal activity of the pristine Ni catalyst and the 96Ni-4W alloy is provided in temperature ranges of 500–650 °C and 475–725 °C, respectively. The maximum yield of CNF for 2 h of reaction was 63 g/gcat for 100Ni and 112 g/gcat for 96Ni-4W catalyst. Longevity tests showed that nickel undergoes fast deactivation (after 3 h), whereas the 96Ni-4W catalyst remains active for 7 h of interaction. The effects of the catalyst’s composition and the reaction temperature upon the structural and morphological characteristics of synthesized carbon nanofibers were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopies. The initial stages of the carbon erosion process were precisely examined by transmission electron microscopy coupled with elemental mapping. The segmented structure of CNF was found to be prevailing in a range of 500–650 °C. The textural parameters of carbon product (SBET and Vpore) were shown to reach maximum values (374 m2/g and 0.71 cm3/g, respectively) at the reaction temperature of 550 °C.",

    "abstract": "Retired chemically polluted sites in southern Jiangsu Province, China, are characterized by dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) and extremely thick aquifers (>30 m), which pose substantial challenges for determining investigation and remediation depths during redevelopment and exploitation. This study constructed a 2D groundwater transport model using TMVOC to systematically investigate the migration, diffusion, and natural attenuation processes of two typical DNAPLs—1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) and carbon tetrachloride (CTC)—under three scenarios: individual transport, mixed transport, and heterogeneous aquifer conditions, with a simulation period of 35 years. In individual transport scenarios, DCE and CTC showed distinct migration behaviors. DCE achieved a maximum vertical transport distance of 14.01 m and a downstream migration distance of 459.58 m, while CTC reached 13.57 m vertically and 453.51 m downstream. When transported as a mixture, their migration was inhibited: DCE’s vertical and downstream distances decreased to 13.76 m and 440.46 m, respectively; and CTC’s to 13.23 m and 420.32 m, likely due to mutual solvent effects that altered their physicochemical properties such as viscosity and solubility. Under natural attenuation conditions, both DNAPLs ceased downstream transport by the end of the 6th year. DCE concentrations dropped below its risk control value (0.81 mg/L) by the 14th year, and CTC (with a risk control value of 0.23 mg/L) by the 11th year. By the 10th year, DCE’s downstream plume had retreated to 48.65 m, and CTC’s to 0.95 m. In heterogeneous aquifers, vertical upward transport of DCE and CTC increased to 14.82 m and 14.22 m, respectively, due to the partial absence of low-conductivity silt layers, while their downstream distances decreased to 397.99 m and 354.11 m, constrained by low-permeability lenses in the migration path. These quantitative results clarify the dynamic differences in DNAPL transport under varying conditions, highlighting the impacts of multicomponent interactions, natural attenuation, and aquifer heterogeneity. They provide critical references for risk management, scientific determination of remediation depths, and safe exploitation of retired chemically polluted sites with similar hydrogeological characteristics.",

Dutasteride as a 5-reductase inhibitor is useful for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. Because of a large variety of solvents and reagents used in the synthesis, it was necessary to develop new, sensitive and selective gas chromatography (GC) methods. The optimization of the methods consisted in selecting different types of sample injection and detection as well as optimization of experimental conditions that allowed to meet the appropriate range (10-120% of the specification limit) and suitable detection limits (LOD) of compounds. Significant differences in the volatility of these compounds forced the division into volatile solvents (methanol, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, heptane and toluene) analyzed with the use of the gas chromatography with headspace (GC-HS) and less volatile compounds (pyridine, dimethylformamide, 1,4-dioxane, acetic acid, ethylene glycol, 4-dimethylaminopyridine) analyzed with the use of gas chromatography with direct injection (GC-FID). Benzene, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane are potential contaminants of toluene and dichloromethane, thus the control of these solvents was a limit test procedure. Due to the low specification limits for benzene (2 ppm), carbon tetrachloride (4 ppm) and 1,2-dichloroethane (5 ppm) it was neccesery to use gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS).\n        All three new methods were validated according to the requirements of the ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) validation guideline Q2R1 and the guideline for residual solvents Q3C.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe synthesis and characterization of graft copolymers are reported based on linear poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) and chiral, pendant benzene‐1,3,5‐tricarboxamides (BTAs). The copolymers differ in degree of polymerization (DP) and BTA graft density. Characterization of the bulk materials at room temperature reveals that the BTAs aggregate in a helical fashion via threefold hydrogen‐bond formation within the PDMS matrix. A significant degree of hydrogen bonding persists up to 180 °C, regardless of DP and BTA content. Analysis of the solution behavior by 1H NMR spectroscopy indicates that BTA aggregation occurs in CDCl3, a solvent normally suppressing aggregation. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in 1,2‐dichloroethane shows strong CD effects and reveals that increasing the DP and decreasing the BTA graft density results in an increase in the cooperativity of the BTA aggregation. Dynamic light scattering indicates the formation of particles with sizes of 400 nm. This is the first time that polymers with pendant BTAs show a sharp transition between a nonaggregated and aggregated state, a behavior similar to the one observed for “free” BTAs. The cooperative aggregation is attributed to the strong phase‐segregation between the PDMS backbone and the BTAs, in combination with a high propensity of these polymers to form multichain aggregates.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Background Occupational hazards such as solvents and noise in the electronics industry are serious. Although various occupational health risk assessment models have been applied in the electronics industry, they have only been used to assess the risks of individual job positions. Few existing studies have focused on the total risk level of critical risk factors in enterprises. Methods Ten electronics enterprises were selected for this study. Information, air samples and physical factor measurements were collected from the selected enterprises through on-site investigation, and then the data were collated and samples were tested according to the requirements of Chinese standards. The Occupational Health Risk Classification and Assessment Model (referred to as the Classification Model), the Occupational Health Risk Grading and Assessment Model (referred to as the Grading Model), and the Occupational Disease Hazard Evaluation Model were used to assess the risks of the enterprises. The correlations and differences between the three models were analyzed, and the results of the models were validated by the average risk level of all of the hazard factors. Results Hazards with concentrations exceeding the Chinese occupational exposure limits (OELs) were methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, and noise. The exposure time of workers ranged from 1 to 11 h per day and the frequency of exposure ranged from 5 to 6 times per week. The risk ratios (RRs) of the Classification Model, the Grading Model and the Occupational Disease Hazard Evaluation Model were 0.70 ± 0.10, 0.34 ± 0.13, and 0.65 ± 0.21, respectively. The RRs for the three risk assessment models were statistically different (P < 0.001), and there were no correlations between them (P > 0.05). The average risk level of all of the hazard factors was 0.38 ± 0.18, which did not differ from the RRs of the Grading Model (P > 0.05). Conclusions The hazards of organic solvents and noise in the electronics industry are not negligible. The Grading Model offers a good reflection of the actual risk level of the electronics industry and has strong practicability.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n          \n            1,2-Dichloroethane (DCA) is a problematic xenobiotic groundwater pollutant. Bacteria are capable of biodegrading DCA, but the evolution of such bacteria is not well understood. In particular, the mechanisms by which bacteria acquire the key dehalogenase genes\n            dhlA\n            and\n            dhlB\n            have not been well defined. In this study, the genomic context of\n            dhlA\n            and\n            dhlB\n            was determined in three aerobic DCA-degrading bacteria (\n            Starkeya novella\n            strain EL1,\n            Xanthobacter autotrophicus\n            strain EL4, and\n            Xanthobacter flavus\n            strain EL8) isolated from a groundwater treatment plant (GTP). A haloalkane dehalogenase gene (\n            dhlA\n            ) identical to the canonical\n            dhlA\n            gene from\n            Xanthobacter\n            sp. strain GJ10 was present in all three isolates, and, in each case, the\n            dhlA\n            gene was carried on a variant of a 37-kb circular plasmid, which was named pDCA. Sequence analysis of the\n            repA\n            replication initiator gene indicated that pDCA was a member of the pTAR plasmid family, related to catabolic plasmids from the\n            Alphaproteobacteria\n            , which enable growth on aromatics, dimethylformamide, and tartrate. Genes for plasmid replication, mobilization, and stabilization were identified, along with two insertion sequences (IS\n            Xa1\n            and IS\n            Pme1\n            ) which were likely to have mobilized\n            dhlA\n            and\n            dhlB\n            and played a role in the evolution of aerobic DCA-degrading bacteria. Two haloacid dehalogenase genes (\n            dhlB1\n            and\n            dhlB2\n            ) were detected in the GTP isolates;\n            dhlB1\n            was most likely chromosomal and was similar to the canonical\n            dhlB\n            gene from strain GJ10, while\n            dhlB2\n            was carried on pDCA and was not closely related to\n            dhlB1\n            . Heterologous expression of the DhlB2 protein confirmed that this plasmid-borne dehalogenase was capable of chloroacetate dechlorination.\n          \n          \n            IMPORTANCE\n            Earlier studies on the DCA-degrading\n            Xanthobacter\n            sp. strain GJ10 indicated that the key dehalogenases\n            dhlA\n            and\n            dhlB\n            were carried on a 225-kb linear plasmid and on the chromosome, respectively. The present study has found a dramatically different gene organization in more recently isolated DCA-degrading\n            Xanthobacter\n            strains from Australia, in which a relatively small circular plasmid (pDCA) carries both\n            dhlA\n            and\n            dhlB\n            homologs. pDCA represents a true organochlorine-catabolic plasmid, first because its only obvious metabolic phenotype is dehalogenation of organochlorines, and second because acquisition of this plasmid provides both key enzymes required for carbon-chlorine bond cleavage. The discovery of the alternative haloacid dehalogenase\n            dhlB2\n            in pDCA increases the known genetic diversity of bacterial chloroacetate-hydrolyzing enzymes.",

In the case of 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination, a 6-fold improvement in Faradaic efficiency and a 19-fold increase in partial current density are demonstrated. Through electrochemical kinetic studies, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and computational simulations, we further find that CO2 reduction reduces hydrogen coverage on the Cu catalyst, which not only exposes more active sites for the dechlorination reaction but also enhances the effective reductive potential on the catalyst surface and reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate-determining step.",

Here we evaluate the ozone depletion potential (ODP) of these Cl‐VSLS using a three‐dimensional chemical transport model and investigate sensitivity to emission location/season. The seasonal dependence of the ODPs is small, but ODPs vary by a factor of 2–3 depending on the continent of emission: 0.0143–0.0264 (CHCl3), 0.0097–0.0208 (CH2Cl2), 0.0057–0.0198 (C2Cl4), and 0.0029–0.0119 (C2H4Cl2). Asian emissions produce the largest ODPs owing to proximity to the tropics and efficient troposphere‐to‐stratosphere transport of air originating from industrialized East Asia.

In this work, Nb/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method, and their performance for EDC oxidation was evaluated. The addition of Nb improved the activity, selectivity, and stability of CeO2. Nb was highly dispersed on CeO2 surface in the form of NbOx, and partially entered the lattice of CeO2. This caused lattice distortion and more surface defects, thereby increasing the number of oxygen vacancies. NbOCe bonds formed in between Nb and CeO2 weakened the CeO bonds and enhanced lattice oxygen mobility. The presence of NbOx increased the number of Lewis acid (NbO) and Brønsted acid (Nb-OH) sites, which facilitated the cleavage of CCl and CC bonds. Increased acidity promoted the removal of Cl species in the form of HCl and effectively mitigated the chlorine poisoning of CeO2.

    "doi": "10.1128/aem.01501-24",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Reductive dehalogenases (RDases) are essential in the anaerobic degradation of various organohalide contaminants. This family of enzymes has broad sequence diversity, but high structural conservation. There have been few studies assessing how RDase amino acid sequences affect their substrate selectivity. Here, we focus on two chloroalkane RDases, CfrA and DcrA, which have 95% protein sequence identity but have diverged to have opposite substrate preferences. CfrA dechlorinates chloroform (CF) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) but not 1,1-dichloroethane (DCA), while DcrA will dechlorinate 1,1-DCA but not CF or 1,1,1-TCA. We mutated several residues in the active site of CfrA to investigate a change in substrate preference and to identify which wild-type residues contribute the most to substrate specialization. We determined that no individual residue solely dictates substrate discrimination, but both Y80W and F125W mutations were needed to force CfrA to prefer 1,1-DCA as a substrate. When using 1,1,2-TCA as a substrate, CfrA predominately performs hydrogenolysis to 1,2-DCA, yet the introduction of the double mutant changed this preference to dihaloelimination (forming vinyl chloride). We use predictive protein models and substrate docking to predict what interactions are made between the enzyme and substrate to aid in selection. The residues of significance identified in this study are consistent with those identified from chloroethene RDases, suggesting residue locations with a particularly high impact on activity. IMPORTANCE Reductive dehalogenases (RDases) play an integral role in the removal of chlorinated solvents from the environment. These enzymes have specificity toward different chlorinated compounds, and it is known that natural variants of highly similar RDases can have distinct activities. How specific differences in protein sequence influence activity is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that mutating a few residues within the active site of CfrA—a chloroform and trichloroethane-specific dehalogenase—changes its substrate preference to dichloroethane. We determine that only two mutations are needed to disrupt the native activity, underscoring the nuances in substrate-structure relationships in RDases. Though we are still far from predicting function from the sequence, this knowledge can give some insight into engineering RDases for new target contaminants.

Here, a Cr-modified RuO2/TiO2 catalyst was fabricated and employed for 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) destruction. The synergy of Cr2O3 and RuO2/TiO2 enhances the exposure of surface Ru, generating abundant reducible Cr6+ and Ru4+ species and chemically adsorbed oxygen, which promote the activity and CO2/HCl selectivity in 1,2-DCE decomposition evidently. 1,2-DCE primarily activates on the Lewis acid sites (LAS) over RuO2/Cr2O3/TiO2 with C-Cl cleavage. Meanwhile, C-C cleavage occurs along with the dehydrochlorination and chlorination reactions. The presence of Cr2O3 greatly improves the LAS concentration and redox ability of RuO2/TiO2, accelerating the deep destruction of 1,2-DCE and inhibiting the formation of CH2Cl2, C2HCl3 and CHCl3.

The first acetoxylation step produced the intermediates (SbQ3)Pt(Cl)(OAc) (1a) and (SbQ2Ph)Pt(Cl)(OAc) (2a). The reaction was studied using pseudo first order kinetics (excess DCE) in order to compare the rates of reaction of 1 and 2, which revealed that kobs = 2.44(6) × 10–4 s–1 for 1 and 0.51(2) × 10–4 s–1 for 2.

In part one, compared to the control, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in 0.9 g/m31,2‐DCE group, and microsomal CYP2E1 protein expression and activity in both 0.45 and 0.9 g/m31,2‐DCE groups increased significantly; conversely, hepatic nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in both 0.45 and 0.9 g/m31,2‐DCE groups and hepatic SOD activities in 0.9 g/m31,2‐DCE group decreased significantly. In part two, microsomal CYP2E1 protein expression and activity decreased significantly in both low and high intervention groups compared to 1,2‐DCE‐poisoned group. Along with the changes of CYP2E1, hepatic MDA levels and serum ALT activities decreased; conversely, hepatic NPSH levels and SOD activities increased significantly in high intervention group. Taken together, our results suggested that 1,2‐DCE could enhance CYP2E1 protein expression and enzymatic activity, which could cause oxidative damage in liver, serving as an important mechanism underlying 1,2‐DCE‐induced liver damage. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Introduction. The study of 1,3-oxazine derivatives plays a crucial role in the field of heterocyclic chemistry. However, there is a lack of systematized information in the literature regarding the synthesis methods of bis-derivatives of 1,3-oxazin-6-ones. The development of efficient methods for obtaining these oxazines, as well as the study of their structure, properties, and biological activity, represents a promising direction for both medicinal chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry.Aim. To develop a laboratory method for the synthesis of bis(4-hydroxy-6H-1,3-oxazin-6-ones) based on the reaction of benzene-1,3-dicarboxamide and benzene-1,4-dicarboxamide with substituted malonyl chlorides, and to confirm their structure using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on 1H and 13C nuclei.Material and methods. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-600 spectrometer in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6), and their processing was carried out using ACD/Labs software. The progress of the reactions was monitored using thin-layer chromatography on plates coated with silica gel TLC Silicagel 60 F254 using ethyl acetate as the eluent and detection in ultraviolet (UV) light. The synthesis procedure included suspending 1 mmol of terephthalic or isophthalic acid diamide in absolute 1,2-dichloroethane, adding 2,4 mmol of substituted malonyl chloride and refluxing the mixture for 15 hours. The end of the reaction was determined by the absence of the initial diamides in the reaction mass by thin-layer chromatography.Results and discussion. As a result of the study a laboratory method of the synthesis of bis(4-hydroxy-6H-1,3-oxazine-6-ones) with phenylene bridges between heterocyclic fragments was developed. The use of absolute 1,2-dichloroethane as a solvent made it possible to increase the yield of the target compounds by 5–7 % and reduce the synthesis time by 5 hours compared to absolute benzene. The structure of the obtained compounds was proved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on 1H and 13C nuclei. The spectra of the obtained compounds contain all the characteristic signals corresponding to bis(4-hydroxy-6H-1,3-oxazine-6-ones).Conclusion. A laboratory method for the synthesis of bis(4-hydroxy-6H-1,3-oxazin-6-ones) has been developed, implemented, and optimized based on the reaction of benzene-1,3-dicarboxamide and benzene-1,4-dicarboxamide with monosubstituted malonyl chlorides. The target compounds were obtained in absolute 1,2-dichloroethane with yields close to quantitative, confirming the efficiency of the developed approach. The structure of all obtained bis(4-hydroxy-6H-1,3-oxazin-6-ones) was reliably established using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on 1H and 13C nuclei.",

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Environmental Technology Verification Program (ETV) to facilitate the deployment of innovative environmental technologies through performance verification and information dissemination. The goal of the ETV Program is to further environmental protection by substantially accelerating the acceptance and use of improved and cost-effective technologies. The ETV Program is intended to assist and inform those involved in the design, distribution, permitting, and purchase of environmental technologies. Under this program, in partnership with recognized testing organizations, and with the full participation of the technology developer, the EPA evaluates the performance of innovative technologies by developing demonstration plans, conducting field tests, collecting and analyzing the demonstration results, and preparing reports. The testing is conducted in accordance with rigorous quality assurance protocols to ensure that data of known and adequate quality are generated and that the results are defensible. The EPA National Exposure Research Laboratory, in cooperation with Sandia National Laboratories, the testing organization, evaluated field-portable systems for monitoring chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in water. This verification statement provides a summary of the demonstration and results for the Inficon HAPSITE field-portable gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) system. DEMONSTRATION DESCRIPTION The field demonstration of the HAPSITE portable GC/MS was held in September 1997. The demonstration was designed to assess the instrument's ability to detect and measure chlorinated volatile organic compounds in groundwater at two contaminated sites: the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site, near Aiken, South Carolina, and the McClellan Air Force Base, near Sacramento, California. Groundwater samples from each site were supplemented with performance evaluation (PE) samples of known composition. Both sample types were used to assess instrument accuracy, precision, sample throughput, and comparability to reference laboratory results. The primary target compounds at the Savannah River Site were trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene. At McClellan Air iii Force Base, the target compounds were trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,2­ trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloropropane, and trans-1,3-dichloropropene. These sites were chosen because they contain varied concentrations of …",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Vinyl chloride, which has a polytropic effect on the human body is the main harmful substance in the production of vinyl chloride and polyvinyl chloride. The aim of the study was to analyze the dynamics (after 5 years) of the cytokine profile and autoimmune response against the proteins of the nervous tissue in workers with continued chronic exposure to toxicants. Material and methods. The paper presents the results of a laboratory immunological examination of those working in the production of vinyl chloride with an average level of occupational risk caused by exposure to vinyl chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane. Results. The character of cytokine regulation disorders in a primary examination in healthy workers and persons with initial manifestations of neurointoxication with vinyl chloride is characterized by a rise in proinflammatory IL-1β and IL-4 with a simultaneous decrease in IL-2 and TNFα, and a more pronounced hyperproduction IL-1β against the background of a decline in IL-4 and IL-2. At repeated examination 5 years after the increase of immunity intensity in healthy workers and disbalance in the system of pro - antiinflammatory cytokines in persons with initial manifestations of neurointoxication was registered, which determines the different degree of the manifestation of compensatory and protective responses that do not allow the full implementation of protective mechanisms in the case of chronic exposure. Discussion. A more pronounced decrease in immunoreactivity relative to the proteins of the nervous tissue in workers with initial manifestations of neurointoxication in the dynamics of chronic effects of production factors is shown. The results obtained made it possible to identify informative biomarkers (IL-1β, TNFα, INFγ, IL-4, S-100, NF-200, TMP) that allow us evaluating the degree of the expression of compensatory-protective responses of the immune response and can be used to monitor the development of the pathological process. Conclusion. Identification of the leading immunopathogenetic factors of neurological deficiency can be the basis for elaborating a method for predicting the individual risk of developing professional neurointoxication.",

In this work the use of solvent descriptors to define weakly coordinating solvents and to identify new candidates for electrochemical applications is discussed. A set of solvent selection criteria are identified based on Kamlet and Taft's π*, α and β parameters: suitable solvents should be polar (π* ≥ 0.55), aprotic and weakly coordinating (α and β ≤ 0.2.). Five candidate solvents were identified and compared to dichloromethane: trifluorotoluene, o-dichlorobenzene, p-fluorotoluene, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichloroethane. The solvents were compared using a suite of measurements including electrolyte voltammetric window, conductivity, and differential capacitance, and the electrochemistry of two model redox couples (decamethylferrocene and cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate). Ion pairing is identified as a determining feature in weakly coordinating solvents and the criteria for selecting a solvent for electrochemistry is considered. o-dichlorobenzene and 1,2-dichloroethane are shown to be the most promising of the five for application to electrodeposition because of their polarity.",

Extended consideration including the nonequilibrium structures within the framework of ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) revealed the importance of torsion molecular motions not covered by the static case. The strong impact of solute-solvent hydrogen bonding on stabilization of these nonequilibrium structures and on conformational composition of DBIQ was demonstrated. A presence of twisted nonplanar geometries along the whole MD trajectory was shown to drastically influence not only energies but also characters of electronic excitations, resulting in a change of local π-π* character in a solution of 1,2-dichloroethane to charge-transfer character in polar dimethylsulfoxide.",

Herein, Pt catalysts on a TiO2 support with different crystal phases (rutile, anatase, and mixed phase (P25)) were prepared for catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). The Pt catalyst on P25-TiO2 (Pt/TiO2-P) showed optimal activity, selectivity, and stability, even under high-space velocity and humidity conditions. Due to the strong interaction between Pt and P25-TiO2 originating from the more lattice defects of TiO2, the Pt/TiO2-P catalyst possessed stable Pt0 and Pt2+ species during DCE oxidation and superior redox property, resulting in high activity and stability. Furthermore, the Pt/TiO2-P catalyst possessed abundant hydroxyl groups, which prompted the removal of chlorine species in the form of HCl and significantly decreased the selectivity of vinyl chloride (VC) as the main byproduct. On the other hand, the Pt/TiO2-P catalyst exhibited a different reaction path, in which the hydroxyl groups on its surface activated DCE to form VC and enolic species, besides the lattice oxygen of TiO2 for the Pt catalysts on rutile and anatase TiO2.

    "abstract": "We report a set of voltammetric experiments for studying redox reactions and ion transfer in water microdroplets emulsified in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). The electrochemistry of microdroplets (rdrop ~700 nm) loaded with either ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]4-) or ferricyanide ([Fe(CN)6]3-), chosen due to their hydrophilic nature, was tracked using cyclic voltammetry. These heterogeneous reactions necessitated ion transfer at the droplet interface to maintain charge balance in the two liquid phases during oxidation or reduction, which was facilitated by tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salt in the DCE phase. Experiments were performed with 1) a single macrodroplet (10-7 L) on a macroelectrode (r ~ 1.5 mm), 2) millions of microdroplets (10-15 L) adsorbed on to a macroelectrode (r ~1.5 mm), and 3) at the single microdroplet level via observing individual microdroplet collisions at an ultramicroelectrode (r ~5 μm). We demonstrate that when millions of microdroplets are adsorbed onto a macroelectrode, there are two surprising observations: 1) The half-wave potential (E1/2) for the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- redox couple shifts by +100 mV, which is shown to depend on the number of droplets on the electrode surface. 2) The reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3-, which is assisted by the transfer of TBA+ into the water droplet, displays two waves in the voltammogram. This dual-wave behavior can be explained by the formation of TBAxK3-xFe(CN)6, which is soluble in DCE. Additionally, we demonstrate that the adsorption of microdroplets onto an electrode surface offers a significant amplification (x 103) of the water/oil/electrode three-phase boundary when compared to the adsorption of larger macrodroplets, permitting a rigorous evaluation of heterogeneous chemistry at this distinct interface. In combination, these experiments provide new insights both into energetic and mechanistic information for droplet systems and reactivity differences between ultra-microscale and bulk multiphase systems.",

Depending on the reactor type, the carbon yield varied from 14.0 to 24.2 g/g(cat). The resulting carbon nanofibers possess a segmented structure with disordered packaging of the graphene layers. It is shown that the carbon deposits are also different in density, structure, and morphology, depending on the type of reactor. Thus, the specific surface area changed from 405 to 262 and 286 m2/g for the products from reactor #1, #2, and #3, correspondingly. The main condition providing the growth of a fluffy carbon product is found to be its ability to grow in any direction. If the reactor walls limit the carbon growing process, the carbon product is represented by very dense fibers that can finally crack the reactor.",

Model input parameters provide reasonable values with the site- and compound-specific values relied on by the Human Health Risk Assessment Protocol (HHRAP). This method uses a generic risk assessment, consisting of air dispersion and deposition modeling followed by risk modeling. An intensive evaluation was conducted in the surrounding area of the largest petroleum and petrochemical estate in Thailand, the Maptaphut industrial area, where a large volume of VOCs was emitted, with an increasing negative health impact on the local population. The potential inhalation health risk assessment showed that the lifetime cancer risk in all residential areas is higher than the health benchmarks. The highest cancer risk was 7.82 × 10−2 in children and 3.91 × 10−1 in adults. The inhalation effects are based on the specific emission rates, the united concentrations and deposition fluxes, and the emission phase. The results revealed that four VOCs (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, vinyl chloride, and 1,2-dichloroethane) should be given priority when controlling for sustainable health risk management through the comprehensive analysis of the integrated analysis of air dispersion and health risk mathematical models.",

Characterization by X-ray diffraction, Raman, NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), CO2-TPD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and H2-temperature-programmed reduction indicates that CeO2 exists as a form of face-centered cubic fluorite structure, whereas the chemical states and the structure of Ru species are dependent on the Ce content. The reducibility and acidity of catalysts increase with Ce/Ce + Al ratio. However, the latter is promoted only in a Ce/Ce + Al range of 0–0.25 and then decreases quickly. Ru/CexAly catalysts have considerable activity for 1,2-DCE combustion. TOFRu of 1,2-DCE oxidation increases with strong acid, which is ascribed to a synergy of reducibility and acidity. Ru greatly inhibits the chlorination through the decreases in both Cl deposition and CH2=CHCl formation. High stability of Ru/Ce10Al90 maintains at 280 °C for at least 25 h with CO2 selectivity of 99% or higher.

An ideal IS is a compound that has properties very similar to, and that behaves as the compounds to be analysed. Ideally, only in the last step of analysis (HPLC), the IS should be well separated from the compounds of the mixture to be analysed. After testing several existing compounds with negative results, we decided to synthesise the 19-O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-13-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-steviol as IS. This is the 19-galactosyl ester of steviolmonoside (13-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-steviol). The IS was made according to published methods. Steviolmonoside (SM) was made from purified commercial rubusoside (Rub) by refluxing it in 10% KOH for 2 h. SM was precipitated and crystallized from MeOH. The hydroxyls of the glucose unit of SM were protected by acetylation. The acetylated SM was crystallized from acetone and dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane. Then Ag2CO3 on Celite and tetra-acetylated galactopyranosyl bromide were added and the mixture was refluxed for 2 h. After cooling, BaO in MeOH was added to remove the acetyl groups. The 1,2-dichloroethane fraction was then extracted three times with equal volumes of water and the water fraction containing the IS was further purified on a C18 flash chromatography column. Traces of unreacted SM were removed by preparative HPLC on an Alltima C18 column (250 mm × 22 mm, particle size 10 μm) with AcCN:water (35:65, 20 ml/min). Detection was at 210 nm (KNAUER, “Smartline” UV detector 2500). The collected IS fraction from the HPLC was completely dried. Mixtures of steviol glycosides (SVglys) containing IS could be purified over SPE cartridges without change of the SVgly over IS ratio. The calibration curves for rebaudioside A (RebA) and stevioside (ST) were linear between 0.012 and 0.95 and between 0.013 and 1.13 mM for RebA and ST, respectively.

The relationship between the structures of the surfactants C12-DADS, C12-MADS and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (C12-LAS) and their surface and interfacial properties was studied by measuring equilibrium surface tensions, dynamic surface tensions and dynamic interfacial tensions (IFT). The results show that the surface and interfacial activity of C12-MADS is better than that of C12-DADS and C12-LAS. The gemini surfactant C12-DADS shows most unfavorable surface and interfacial activity due to the fact that the cross-linked hydrophobic carbon chains decreases the number of exposed methyl in molecule. The dynamic surface tensions results show that the diffusion coefficients values of C12-MADS and C12-DADS are lower than that of C12-LAS, and the adsorption process of surfactants at air/water interface is a mixed diffusion-kinetic adsorption mechanism. The data of dynamic ITF between aqueous surfactants solutions and dodecane indicate that the NaCl and CaCl2 concentration has a weak effect on the stable value of dynamic IFT for C12-DADS. With increasing the NaCl and CaCl2 concentration, the stable values of dynamic ITF for the three surfactants mostly passes through a minimum at an optimum concentration, and the C12-MADS and C12-LAS can reduce the IFT to the 10−2 mN/m order of magnitude.",

A typical CTL system coupled with a plasma-ozone-assist unit was designed for promoting the CTL response of dichloroalkanes. The ozone generated by plasma provides a new pathway of catalytic oxidation process, which accompanied by the CTL signal amplification of dichloroalkanes results in an enhanced CTL sensor system with improved limit of detection (1,2-dichloroethane: 0.04 μg mL-1, 1,2-dichloropropane: 0.03 μg mL-1) and benign selective performance under the interference of CO2, H2O, NO, NO2, SO2, CS2, and other common CVOCs.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Diffusion is a fundamental process in various domains, such as pollution control, drug delivery, and isotope separation. Accurately measuring the diffusion coefficients (D) of one liquid into another often encounters challenges stemming from intermolecular interactions, precise observations at the liquid interface, convection, etc. Here, we present an innovative electrochemical methodology for determining the diffusion coefficient of a liquid into another liquid. The method involves precisely tracking the lifetime of a nonaqueous droplet. An organic droplet is placed on an ultramicroelectrode surrounded by an aqueous solution of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II/III). The droplet initially blocks the reduction or oxidation of the redox species. As the droplet dissolves, giving access to the conductive microelectrode surface, a continuously increasing current is observed in voltammetry and the amperometric i-t response. The electrochemical response thus directly reports on the flux of redox species on the electrode surface, allowing us to precisely determine the lifetime of the droplet. D values are directly determined through a combination of electrochemical analysis and the principles of droplet dissolution. We demonstrate the quantification of 1,2-dichloroethane and nitrobenzene into water, yielding diffusion coefficients of (11.3 ± 1.2) × 10-6 cm2/s and (5.2 ± 1.1) × 10-6 cm2/s, respectively.

Global surface observations have shown that the tropospheric abundance of CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 has increased significantly in recent years. For instance, the global surface abundance of CH2Cl2 has more than doubled since the early 2000s and in 2018 was ~42 ppt. Despite this, there has been no recent attempt to create a consistent set of gridded Cl-VSLS emissions with which global models can use to study their impacts. Here, we describe and evaluate a new set of gridded time-varying global emissions of CH2Cl2, CHCl3, C2Cl4 and C2H4Cl2, informed by novel bottom-up industrial emission data. The performance of the emission inventories in the TOMCAT chemical transport model are assessed using data from both long-term surface monitoring networks and a range of tropospheric aircraft campaigns.

We synthesized poly(4-trimethylsilylstyrene-co-vinylbenzyl chloride-co-divinylbenzene)s (P(TMSS-co-VBzCl-co-DVB)s) with different compositions by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer copolymerization and converted them into HCPs by reacting with FeCl3 in 1,2-dichloroethane. The nearly quantitative removal of the TMS groups was observed during the reaction following the electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism, where the TMS group shows higher reactivity than an aromatic hydrogen. Substantial enhancement in pore characteristics including surface area, microporosity, and mesoporosity was noticed up to a certain level of TMSS incorporation, compared with HCP derived from P(VBzCl-co-DVB). We suggest the porogenic TMS group increases porosity mainly by in situ removal via facilitated substitution reaction, which creates permanent voids in the hyper-cross-linked network. The use of TMSS provides a feasible and complementary route to tuning the pore characteristics of HCPs by varying DVB content, and is applicable to the synthesis of hierarchically porous polymers containing micropores within a mesoporous framework from block polymer precursors.",

We find that the affinity of the organic solvent for the palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) as catalysts and the vertical position of the organic and aqueous phases in the biphasic system are important considerations for synthesizing a robust copper film. Specifically, 1,2-dichloroethane which has an appropriate affinity for PdNPs and a higher density than water was found to be a good candidate for use as the organic phase in this system. However, a poor-quality copper film was obtained in the system with 1-hexanol as the organic phase. We also controlled the microscale surface structure of the copper films by using different concentrations of the injected PdNP dispersion. A high density of PdNPs caused smaller regions of metal growth, which contributed to the formation of smoother metal films. Moreover, under the optimal synthesis condition, we confirmed the electrical conductivity of the obtained copper film to be 1.16 × 10-7 Ωm.

Consequently, analyses of cosmetic products are an essential necessity, particularly in terms of human health and safety. In this study, a highly accurate and sensitive liquid-phase-based microextraction method was developed to determine the five parabens at trace levels by high-performance liquid chromatography. All prominent parameters of the method such as extraction solvent type and amount (1,2-dichloroethane/250 μL), and dispersive solvent type and amount (isopropyl alcohol/2.0 mL) were optimized to enhance the extraction efficiency of the analytes. The mobile phase consisting of 50 mM ammonium formate aqueous solution (pH 4.0) and acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) was used to elute the analytes at a flow rate of 1.2 mL min−1 in the isocratic mode. Analytical performance of the optimum method for methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and benzyl parabens were determined and the analytes recorded detection limit values of 0.78, 0.75, 0.34, 0.33 and 0.75 μg kg−1, respectively. Four different lipstick samples were analyzed under optimum conditions of the developed method, and the amount of parabens quantified in the samples using matrix matched calibration standards was in the range of 0.11–1.03%.",

The ITIES is formed between organic and aqueous phases. Organic solvent identity is crucial to the detection characteristics of the ITIES [half-wave transfer potential (E1/2), potential window range, limit of detection, transfer coefficient (α), standard heterogeneous ion-transfer rate constant (k0), etc.]. Here, we demonstrated, for the first time at the nanoscale, the detection characteristics of the NPOE/water ITIES. Linear detection of the diffusion-limited current at different concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) was demonstrated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and i-t amperometry. The E1/2 of ACh transfer at the NPOE/water nanoITIES was -0.342 ± 0.009 V versus the E1/2 of tetrabutylammonium (TBA+). The limit of detection of ACh at the NPOE/water nanoITIES was 37.1 ± 1.5 μM for an electrode with a radius of ∼127 nm. We also determined the ion-transfer kinetics parameters, α and k0, of TBA+ at the NPOE/water nanoITIES by fitting theoretical cyclic voltammograms to experimental voltammograms. This work lays the basis for future cellular studies using ACh detection at the nanoscale and for studies to detect other analytes. The NPOE/water ITIES offers a potential window distinct from that of the 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE)/water ITIES.

The hydrolysis of I with acetic acid in a 5:1 acetone/water mixture, in the presence of two equivalents of tbbpy and excess NaX (X = Br, I), yields the dipalladated terephthalaldehyde complexes [C6H2{PdX(tbbpy)}2-1,4-(CHO)2-2,5] [X = Br (2a), X = I (2b)], which are the first fully characterized complexes of this type.

TVOC concentrations peaked before dawn, a pattern attributed to early morning industrial activities and nighttime heavy vehicle operations. During periods classified as clean, when ozone levels were below 160 μg m−3, both TVOC (15.9 ± 12.9 ppb) and OFP (90.4 ± 110.0 μg m−3) concentrations were higher than those during polluted hours. The analysis identified the key sources of VOC emissions, including automobile exhaust, oil and gas evaporation, and industrial discharges, with additional potential pollution sources identified in adjacent regions. Health risk assessments indicated that acrolein exceeded the non-carcinogenic risk threshold at specific times. Moreover, trichloromethane, 1,3-butadiene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and benzene were found to surpass the acceptable lifetime carcinogenic risk level (1 × 10−6) during certain periods. These findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced monitoring and regulatory measures aimed at mitigating VOC emissions and protecting public health in industrial areas. In the context of complex air pollution in urban industrial areas, policymakers should focus on controlling industrial and vehicle emissions, which can not only reduce secondary pollution, but also inhibit the harm of toxic substances on human health.",

    "doi": "10.54033/cadpedv21n5-160",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "High-purity distillation columns are processes in which you want to minimally increase the purity of a key component by separation. These processes are sensitive to disturbances, where small changes in the feed flowrate stream cause drastic changes in product compositions. Furthermore, when one wants to apply traditional control and optimization techniques to these processes, some difficulties have to be faced: the process is generally non-linear and has a long response time, there are many immeasurable disturbances, it is difficult to keep the process in steady-state, and the bottom and top compositions are highly coupled. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology for the development of soft sensors (SS), here in applied to an industrial 1,2-Dichloroethane separation plant. The process was simulated and validated with real data from the industrial plant. In the step second an algorithm based on multivariate statistics was developed for the selection of inputs SS variables. The configuration for training multilayer artificial neural network (ANN's) was optimize, accounting for the ANN's prediction capacity of responses and the rejection of disturbances inserted in the process. Thereafter, a temperature control was implemented to maintain the impurity compositions within specifications but failed due to the small temperature variations in the high purity column. To overcome these difficulty three inferential control strategies (impurity composition estimated by the SS) were implemented: a classic feedback control, a cascade control, and a ratio-cascade control. All control strategies acted to minimize the process disturbances effects. However, the inferential ratio-cascade control shown to be the most robust, because of the lowest integral error criteria value and percentage overshoot.",

Here, the fluorescence study of the evaporative crystallization of 1,3‐dipyrrol‐2‐yl‐1,3‐propanedione boron difluoride complex (1), which has three polymorphs showing different emission profiles, is reported. The droplet of 1 in 1,2‐dichloroethane showed blue emission just after dropping. Solids with bluish‐green emission were observed. As time elapsed, a solid with red or orange emission was observed around the droplet. Time evolution of the fluorescence spectra, observed for the first time, implied that the molten state of 1 was observed by emission of an intermediate, even at ambient temperature. These findings suggested that the liquid‐like cluster incidentally forms an ordered array as the crystallites nucleate. The liquid‐like cluster can be considered as the “crucible” in the nucleation of polymorphs.",

Consequently, Ru/5CaCo-N-450 catalyst exhibited the excellent activity for the EDC elimination in different reaction conditions, as well as stability against high temperature. The characteristic results revealed that the existing of abundant oxygen vacancies in Ru/5CaCo-N-450 catalyst significantly improved the redox and acidity property and enhanced the high-temperature sintering stability through the interaction of Ru species with Co3O4. The results of in-situ DRIFTS spectra indicated the promoted contribution of oxygen vacancies that facilitated the adsorption and activation of EDC, and synergistic effect between Ru species and Co3O4 benefited to the elimination of absorbed Cl species as well as the ability of deep oxidation for intermediates. Thus, an excellent catalyst with high activity and stability has been investigated in detail using a doping-etching strategy, and the relatively simple and environmentally friendly synthesis method provides a broad prospect for potential industrial applications.",

For oils of different densities, such as 1,2‐dichloroethane, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, n‐hexane, and petroleum ether, the underwater oil contact angle and underwater oil sliding angle of ALD‐modified PPN range from 152.25° to 156.19° and 5.63° to 8.80°, respectively, exhibiting superior superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity. Notably, ALD‐modified PPN shows a high chemical stability in different solutions, such as acid, alkali, salt, and polar solvent, which even can slightly improve the underwater superoleophobicity of TiO2 nano‐coating. The excellent underwater anti‐oil property, self‐cleaning property, robust chemical resistance, and easily scaled‐up preparation process of TiO2‐coated PPN suggest great potential for practical applications in the energy, environmental protection, marine anti‐fouling, and microflow control fields.",

The strain J3 was associated with self-flocculation during the growth process, and the degradation pathway study showed that the bacteria could completely mineralize 1,2-DCA. The microorganism was immobilized and the optimum preparation conditions were obtained by orthogonal experiment: 6 % polyvinyl alcohol, 2 % sodium alginate, 1 % biochar, and 2 % CaCl2, and the immobilized cells were named J3C. The degradation rates of J3C at low pH, temperature, and high concentration NaCl were higher than that of free J3. The fitting results of the pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics model showed that for above 200 mg/L 1,2-DCA, the degradation rate of J3C was higher than that of free J3. The adsorption process of the sterile J3C aligns with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the intraparticle diffusion model. The internal mass transfer kinetics analysis revealed that the beads with biochar and a small diameter (0.34 cm) were more conducive to mass transfer. Finally, remediation of real polluted groundwater by J3C shows that for groundwater with a pH value of about 7, 1,2-DCA concentrations of about 100, 200 mg/L, 1,2-DCA can be completely degraded by J3C, while for groundwater with a pH value of 12, 250 mg/L 1,2-DCA, the degradation rate was 83.15 % by J3C, 66.91 % higher than that of free J3.

The latest cumulative report, the 15th RoC, includes 256 listings of substances - chemical, physical, and biological agents; mixtures; and exposure circumstances - that are known or reasonably anticipated to cause cancer in humans. For each listed substance, a profile, i.e., a short synopsis of key studies on cancer, exposure data, and regulations to limit exposure, is prepared. For readers' convenience, profiles for related exposures or selected members of chemical families often are grouped. The report also includes supplemental information to provide context for the listings, including an introduction, glossary, indexes, and review process. To determine whether a substance should be listed in the RoC, a rigorous assessment is conducted of publicly available, relevant cancer studies in humans and animals and mechanistic studies using systematic review methods and established criteria.

Herein, based on a sequence of reduced graphene oxide (RGOs) with varying contents of OFGs, we have found that the OFGs shown great effect on the electrochemical performance of carbon-based catalysts for DCEDR. Correlation tests indicated that the electrochemical DCEDR performance shown positive correlation only with the content of C=O, suggesting that C=O was the main real active component for DCEDR to ethylene. Further theoretical calculation results revealed that the C atom neighbored to C=O at armchair edge shown the lowest energy barrier of 0.11 eV for DCEDR, which was consistent with the result of experiment. Therefore, C atom neighbored to C=O at armchair edge was the real active site for DCEDR to ethylene.

Kinetic studies on catalytic conversion of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) over NiPd alloy into carbon nanomaterial (CNM) were performed in a flow reactor equipped with McBain balances in a temperature range of 580–700°C. It was shown that interaction of DCE with NiPd system results in a fast disintegration of pristine alloy with formation of submicron (0.2-0.9μm) particles, which efficiently catalyze the growth of segmented carbon filaments. According to Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy data, hydrogen concentration in reaction mixture strongly affects the structural features and density of segmented filaments.

The genome of strain BTF08 encodes 20 genes for reductive dehalogenase homologous proteins (RdhA) including those described for dehalogenation of tetrachloroethene (PceA, PteA), trichloroethene (TceA) and vinyl chloride (VcrA). Thus far it is unknown under which conditions the different RdhAs are expressed, what their substrate specificity is and if different reaction mechanisms are employed. Here we found by proteomic analysis from differentially activated batches that PteA and VcrA were expressed during dechlorination of tetrachloroethene to ethene, while TceA was expressed during 1,2-dichloroethane dehalogenation. Carbon and chlorine compound-specific stable isotope analysis suggested distinct reaction mechanisms for the dechlorination of (i) cis-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride versus (ii) tetrachloroethene. This differentiation was observed independent of the expressed RdhA proteins. Differently, two stable isotope fractionation patterns were observed for 1,2-dichloroethane transformation, for cells with distinct RdhA inventories. Conclusively, we could link specific RdhA expression with functions and provide an insight into the apparently substrate-specific reaction mechanisms in the pathway of reductive dehalogenation in D. mccartyi strain BTF08.

Here, we present a simple method to generate a ‘floating liquid nanofilm’ by trapping a gas bubble at the interface between immiscible aqueous and organic phases. This geometry produces a stable, surfactant-free nanometric film of 1,2-dichloroethane ~75 nm thick, suspended above a gas bubble without a solid|liquid interface. We characterize this confined volume using a cylindrical microelectrode in direct contact with the nanofilm and combine electrochemical measurements with finite element modeling. Using decamethylferrocene as a redox probe, we observe an enhanced oxidation response in the liquid nanofilm. This phenomenon, however, is not observed in oxygen-depleted environments. We attribute this behavior to the redox reaction between decamethylferrocene and dissolved dioxygen, facilitated by selective ion transfer at the interface. Specifically, the addition of an anion soluble in both phases, perchlorate, to the aqueous phase dramatically increases the reduction current, consistent with a Le Chatelier-type shift in equilibrium via phase transfer of superoxide.

    "abstract": "Significance For centuries, scientists have assumed that chemical reactivity in bulk, continuous water is conserved at all levels in nature, from reactions in the ocean to enzymatic digestion in a lysosome. There is growing evidence using mass spectrometry that chemical reaction rates are enhanced by orders of magnitude in micro- and nanodroplets. In this study, we use nanoelectrochemistry to track the enzymatic oxidation of glucose in single attoliter (10−18 L) aqueous nanodroplets, one nanodroplet at a time. When a nanodroplet irreversibly adsorbs onto an ultramicroelectrode surface, the enzymatic reaction can be traced due to the electrochemical regeneration of the enzyme cofactor. We demonstrate the enzymatic reaction rate increases up to 100× for nanodroplets under 1 μm in radius. Enzymes are molecules that catalyze reactions critical to life. These catalysts are often studied in bulk water, where the influence of water volume on reactivity is neglected. Here, we demonstrate rate enhancement of up to two orders of magnitude for enzymes trapped in submicrometer water nanodroplets suspended in 1,2-dichloroethane. When single nanodroplets irreversibly adsorb onto an ultramicroelectrode surface, enzymatic activity is apparent in the amperometric current-time trace if the ultramicroelectrode generates the enzyme cofactor. Nanodroplet volume is easily accessible by integrating the current-time response and using Faraday’s Law. The single nanodroplet technique allows us to plot the enzyme’s activity as a function of nanodroplet size, revealing a strong inverse relationship. Finite element simulations confirm our experimental results and offer insights into parameters influencing single nanodroplet enzymology. These results provide a framework to profoundly influence the understanding of chemical reactivity at the nanoscale.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to develop a convenient preparative method for the direct N-alkylation of 3(5)-methyl-4-nitropyrazole under conditions of phase-transfer catalysis (PTC). The need for development was also dictated by the fact that the reaction products are simultaneously intermediates in the synthesis of an important class of compounds - vinylpyrazoles. Alkylation of 3(5)-methyl-4-nitropyrazole under standard conditions of PTC (benzene-water-KOH-TEBACH (triethylbexylammonium chloride)) did not lead to the desired result. Apparently, benzene interrupts the transfer of the nitropyrazole anion from the aqueous organic medium, as a result of which the yield of the control alkyl compound is only 50%. During alkylation in the absence of benzene, under the influence of potassium hydroxide in water, deprotonation easily proceeds and the corresponding potassium salt of 3(5)-methyl-4-nitropyrazole is formed, which blocks the dehydrochlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane and leads to the selective course of the process of alkylation of the taken nitropyrazole. At an equimolar ratio of nitropyrazole and potassium hydroxide, the yield of a mixture of the resulting 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3- and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-5-methyl-4-nitropyrazoles reaches 80%. The dehydrochlorination of the obtained substituted chloroethylpyrazoles in a methanol solution, under conditions of PTC, and in an aqueous solution of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMO/H2O), in the presence of potassium hydroxide was also studied. Although the homogeneous method of dehydrochlorination is technologically imperfect, however, it makes it possible to obtain a mixture of 1-vinyl-3- and 1-vinyl-5-methyl-4-nitropyrazole isomers with a yield of 45%. Dehydrochlorination under PTC conditions is an alternative to a homogeneous process; however, it is not able to provide a high yield of the expected compounds - 20%. It has been established that the dehydrochlorination of the studied 1-(2̕'-chloroethyl)-3(5)-methyl-4-nitropyrazoles proceeds significantly successfully in the presence of KOH in the NMO/H2O system, leading to the total yield of 1-vinyl-3- and 1-vinyl -5-methyl-4-nitropyrazoles up to 60%. The effects of methyl substituents of the pyrazole ring during radical polymerization have been studied. The identified monomers exhibit different activities under the same conditions. Thus, in the process of radical polymerization, the isomer in which the methyl group is in the fifth position of the pyrazole ring polymerizes at a higher rate than the isomer in which the methyl group is in the third position. \nFor citation: \n Bichakhchyan L.A., Markosyan A.J., Shakhatuni A.G., Badalyan K.S., Attaryan O.S., Khachatryan A.N.

    "abstract": "The Korea-United States Air Quality Study (KORUS-AQ) took place in spring 2016 to better understand air pollution in Korea. In support of KORUS-AQ, 2554 whole air samples (WAS) were collected aboard the NASA DC-8 research aircraft and analyzed for 82 C1–C10 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using multi-column gas chromatography. Together with fast-response measurements from other groups, the air samples were used to characterize the VOC composition in Seoul and surrounding regions, determine which VOCs are major ozone precursors in Seoul, and identify the sources of these reactive VOCs. (1) The WAS VOCs showed distinct signatures depending on their source origins. Air collected over Seoul had abundant ethane, propane, toluene and n-butane while plumes from the Daesan petrochemical complex were rich in ethene, C2–C6 alkanes and benzene. Carbonyl sulfide (COS), CFC-113, CFC-114, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and 1,2-dichloroethane were good tracers of air originating from China. CFC-11 was also elevated in air from China but was surprisingly more elevated in air over Seoul. (2) Methanol, isoprene, toluene, xylenes and ethene were strong individual contributors to OH reactivity in Seoul. However methanol contributed less to ozone formation based on photochemical box modeling, which better accounts for radical chemistry. (3) Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and other techniques indicated a mix of VOC source influences in Seoul, including solvents, traffic, biogenic, and long-range transport. The solvent and traffic sources were roughly equal using PMF, and the solvents source was stronger in the KORUS-AQ emission inventory. Based on PMF, ethene and propene were primarily associated with traffic, and toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes with solvents, especially non-paint solvents for toluene and paint solvents for ethylbenzene and xylenes. This suggests that VOC control strategies in Seoul could continue to target vehicle exhaust and paint solvents, with additional regulations to limit the VOC content in a variety of non-paint solvents.",

Fischer 344 rats were exposed to target concentrations of 0 or 200 ppm of DCE vapors (6 hours/day, 7 days/week) for at least 28 days; 200 ppm represents a concentration of ~20% higher than that reported to induce mammary tumors. Endpoints examined included DNA damage (via Comet assay), glutathione (reduced, oxidized and conjugated), tissue DNA adducts, cell proliferation and serum prolactin levels. Exposure to DCE did not alter serum prolactin levels with consistent estrous stage, did not cause cell proliferation in mammary epithelial cells, nor result in histopathological alterations in the mammary gland. DNA adducts were identified, including the N7‐guanylethyl glutathione adduct, with higher adduct levels measured in liver (nontumorigenic target) compared with mammary tissue isolated from the same rats; no known mutagenic adducts were identified.

Recently, a 26-week short-term carcinogenicity study using CB6F1-Tg rasH2@Jcl (rasH2) mice has become a worldwide standard for the evaluation of chemical carcinogenesis. However, an acceptable short-term carcinogenic study model for dermally applied products is still lacking. To investigate the suitability of using the rasH2 mouse to test carcinogenic potential, 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) was dermally applied to rasH2 mice: 1,2-DCE is a known carcinogen that causes lung bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and adenocarcinomas when administered topically, orally, or by inhalation exposure; 1,2-DCE at a dose level of 126 mg/mouse in 200 μl acetone or acetone alone (vehicle control) was applied to the dorsal skin of 10 mice of each sex 3 times a week for 26 weeks. As a positive control, 10 mice of each sex received a single intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and adenocarcinomas were significantly increased in 1,2-DCE-treated rasH2 mice of both sexes, and bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasias were significantly increased in female mice. Overall, almost all mice of each sex developed adenomas and/or adenocarcinomas with 100% of female rasH2 mice developing bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinomas.",

    "abstract": "1,2‐Dichloroethane is a manmade compound used in the production of vinyl chloride. Due to its toxicity, it generally has relatively low screening levels based on acceptable concentrations in indoor air, soil vapor, and groundwater. If a release of 1,2‐dichloroethane has occurred, the compound may be detected in the subsurface and could be a risk driver for vapor intrusion (VI). Based on studies presented in this paper, however, this compound has become more frequently detected in indoor air and is likely attributed to sources in the buildings being sampled. This paper summarizes current knowledge of indoor air background levels of 1,2‐dichloroethane and potential sources. Recent field data demonstrate that the typical indoor air concentrations for this compound are higher than those reported in the past and may be connected to a larger presence of internationally shipped materials in the current indoor environment than in previous decades. This is an important consideration when evaluating buildings for VI, as background indoor air concentrations of 1,2‐dichloroethane may confound the VI pathway assessment.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "We previously reported that expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) mRNA and protein was upregulated during 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) induced brain edema in mice. We also found that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway resulted in MMP-9 overexpression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in mice treated with 1,2-DCE. In this study, we further hypothesized that inflammatory reactions mediated by the p38 MAPK/ NF-κB signaling pathway might be involved in MMP-9 overexpression, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and edema formation in the brain of 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice. Our results revealed that subacute poisoning by 1,2-DCE upregulates protein levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and p-p65 in mouse brains. Pretreatment with an inhibitor against p38 MAPK attenuates these changes. Moreover, pretreatment with an inhibitor against NF-κB attenuates alterations in brain water content, pathological indications notable in brain edema, as well as mRNA and protein expression on levels of MMP-9, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, iNOS, and IL-1β, tight junction proteins (TJs), GFAP and Iba-1 in the brain of 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with an inhibitor against MMP-9 obstructs the decrease of TJs in the brain of 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice. Lastly, pretreatment with an antagonist against the IL-1β receptor also attenuates changes in protein levels of p-p38 MAPK, p-p65, p-IκB, VCAM -1, ICAM-1, IL-1β, and Iba-1 in the brain of 1,2-DCE-intoxicated-mice. Taken together, findings from the current study indicate that the p38 MAPK/ NF-κB signaling pathway might be involved in the activation of glial cells, and the overproduction of proinflammatory factors, which might induce inflammatory reactions in the brain of 1,2-DCE-intoxicated mice that leads to brain edema.",

However, the compositions and source profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from aircraft are still not clear. In this study, the characteristics of VOCs (including oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs)) emitted from airport sources were measured at Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport. The results showed that the compositions and proportions of VOC species showed significant differences as the aircraft operating state changed. OVOCs were the dominant species and accounted for 63.17%, 58.44%, and 51.60% of the total VOC mass concentration during the taxiing, approach, and take-off stages. Propionaldehyde and acetone were the main OVOCs, and dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane were the main halohydrocarbons. Propane had the highest proportion among all alkanes, while toluene and benzene were the predominant aromatic hydrocarbons. Compared with the source profiles of VOCs from construction machinery, the proportions of halogenated hydrocarbons and alkanes emitted from aircraft were significantly higher, as were those of propionaldehyde and acetone. OVOCs were still the dominant VOC species in aircraft emissions, and their calculated ozone formation potential (OFP) was much higher than that of other VOC species at all stages of aircraft operations. Acetone, propionaldehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and ethylene were the greatest contributors to ozone production. This study comprehensively measured the distribution characteristics of VOCs, and its results will aid in the construction of a source profile inventory of VOCs emitted from aircraft sources in real atmospheric environments.",

    "abstract": "The self-assembly and gas permeability properties of polyphenylacetylene derivatives were investigated as a function of the side-chain structures. When 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD) units were introduced into the side chain of poly(4-substituted phenylacetylene) derivatives by the [2+2] cycloaddition-retroelectrocyclization reaction, a remarkable morphology change was observed in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of their cast films. The precursor polyphenylacetylene showed an unstructured homogeneous surface image, while the 50 mol% TCBD-adducted polymer formed fibrous nanoobjects. Furthermore, the fully TCBD-adducted polymer exhibited a spherical morphology. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of these thin films suggested peaks ascribed to the side chain lengths. The gas permeability and diffusion coefficients of O2 and N2 were measured using the self-standing polymer membranes. The O2 permeability (PO2) was 2.6-2.9 times greater than the corresponding N2 permeability (PN2) irrespective of the side-chain moieties. However, the diffusion coefficients were dramatically reduced by formation of the TCBD units, probably due to the decrease in the void spaces caused by the interactions with the nitrile groups. The different substitution patterns of the side-chain phenyl group also caused different properties.

We now report the postfunctional polynitrile formation on the side chain of polyacetylene derivatives [30]. Considering the chemical stability and rigid backbone, polyphenylacetylene derivatives were selected as the main chain and the desired amounts of the TCBD unit were constructed at the side chains. The polymer films were fabricated by a simple solution-cast method, and their surface morphology and gas permeability coefficients were evaluated. It was determined that characteristic selfassembled nano-structures, such as fibrous and spherical objects, are formed when the TCBD units are introduced into the polyphenylacetylene side chains. These nano-structures are not directly correlated to the selectivity and permeability of the O2 and N2 gases, but explicitly lower their diffusion coefficients probably due to the decrease in the physical void size. 2. Experimental Section 2.1 Materials Toluene and trimethylamine (NEt3) were distilled by reflux in the presence of sodium.

However, increased health concerns about its contamination by organic pollutants and polymeric micro/nonfibrous particulates have arisen in the last few years. Therefore, this work is designed to screen the bottled water marketed in Saudi Arabia for the existence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For this purpose, 40 samples of bottled water from Madinah city’s markets were collected and analyzed to verify their containment of VOCs. The samples were preconcentrated using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by gas chromatography techniques calibrated with an environmental standard mixture containing 26 VOCs. The results confirmed the presence of several volatile organic pollutants in some samples. These pollutants include: 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1DCE), Benzene (B), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2DCE), Bromodichloromethane (BDCM), 1,2-dichloropropane (1,2DCP), 1,4-difluorobenzene (1,4FB), Toluene (T), and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4DCB). Bromodichloromethane is one of the most common compounds found in bottled drinking water, detected in approximately 40% of the samples, followed by Toluene in 35% of the samples.

Obligate organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB), such as Dehalobacter (Dhb), play crucial roles in biotransforming and detoxifying natural or anthropogenic halogenated organics including 1,1,1-TCA and CF through reductive dechlorination. Despite their significance, only five Dhb strains have been associated with the reductive dechlorination of 1,1,1-TCA or CF. Therefore, cultivating and characterizing novel Dhb strains from various environments of different origins worldwide is crucial for understanding the ecology and evolution of Dhb and the associated reductive dehalogenase (RDase) genes. This study reports the enrichment and investigation of a novel Dhb population capable of reducing 1,1,1-TCA to 1,1-dichloroethane, CF to dichloromethane, 1,1,2-TCA to vinyl chloride/1,2-dichloroethane, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The capability for dechlorinating both aliphatic and aromatic compounds was observed for the first time in the sediment sourced from the Xi River situated in the North China Plain. Comparative genomic analysis of Dhb strains revealed genome contraction might have resulted in the loss of various gene family members, contributing to the syntrophy interactions (e.g., cobalamin, hydrogen, and acetate) of Dhb with other anaerobes (e.g., fermenters and acetogens). Proteogenomic and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the highly expressed 1,1,1-TCA/CF-dechlorinating RDase, designated as TcaA, shared 94.7–96.7% amino acid sequence similarities with RDases, such as ThmA, CfrA, and TmrA. This study expands knowledge on Dhb biogeography and evolution while providing insights into potential syntrophy interactions supporting organohalide respiration by Dhb. The findings have implications for developing the novel biotechnologies for the remediation of halogenated alkane-contaminated sites. IMPORTANCE Organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) are essential for breaking down harmful pollutants in the environment. This study investigates a newly discovered OHRB capable of degrading multiple contaminants, including persistent 1,1,1-trichloroethane and chloroform. By understanding its unique abilities and interactions with other microbes, we gain valuable insights into how these bacteria evolve and function, enabling the development of improved bioremediation strategies to clean up polluted sites.

    "abstract": "Introduction. To assess the impact of the toxicants vinyl chloride (VC) and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) on humans, personalized biomonitoring of thiodiacetic acid (TDAA) is of most significant importance. Determination of TDAA in urine was carried out using the method of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS. Materials and methods. Sample preparation consists of the analyte’s esterification in a biological matrix with methyl alcohol (with 10% boron trifluoride), extraction of the derivative by liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. We used an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph with an HP-5MS capillary column and a mass-selective detector. TDAA was identified in the form of a dimethyl ester on a mass chromatogram according to the retention time and the ratio of the intensities of the registered ions. Results. To determine the rational parameters of the sample preparation process for the determination of TDAA in urine studies were carried out under the method of planning the experiment, which makes it possible to obtain the most accurate mathematical description of the processes. Optimization of the conditions for esterification of TDAA was carried out using mathematical planning, varying the temperature, process time, and the nature of the catalyst (BF3 or H2SO4). The scheduling matrix included eight experiments; the degree of conversion of TDAA served as an optimization parameter. Interpretation of the model showed that temperature makes more contribution to the formation of the degree of conversion than the processing time. The nature of the catalyst does not affect the degree of conversion. Conclusion. A mathematical model developed for optimizing the conditions for sample preparation of the biomarker of exposure to VC (TDAA) in urine, showed the contribution of three factors (reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst nature) to the conversion rate, of which the reaction temperature makes the greatest contribution to the choice of optimal esterification conditions. The nature of the catalyst (BF3 or H2SO4) does not affect the conversion rate.",

In this paper, green and efficient Low Transition Temperature Mixtures (LTTMs) were used as solvents to explore their separation performance and mechanism of the n-hexane + DCE azeotrope system. Firstly, the conductor-like screening model for segment activity coefficient (COSMO-SAC) model was used to investigate the effects of the structure and composition of the hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors on the extraction performance. On this basis, three LTTMs were screened out as solvents for the extraction and separation of n-hexane + DCE by combining experiments, which were trimethylamine hydrochloride-levulinic acid 1:2 (LTTM1), tetraethylammonium chloride-levulinic acid 1:2 (LTTM2), tetraethylammonium chloride-pyruvic acid 1:2 (LTTM3). Afterward, Liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE) experiments were carried out for the ternary system of n-hexane + DCE + LTTMs, and the results showed that the extraction of DCE was favored by low temperatures in the experimental temperature range. Then, molecular dynamics simulation was used to investigate the microscopic mechanism of the extraction and separation of n-hexane + DCE by LTTMs. The results showed that the interaction between LTTMs and DCE was much larger than that between LTTMs and n-hexane, n-hexane and DCE, which was the fundamental reason for the separation of n-hexane + DCE by LTTMs. Finally, the continuous separation process of n-hexane + DCE was simulated using Aspen Plus, and the results showed that LTTMs had good extraction performance and the purity of n-hexane and DCE products could reach 99.6 mol% and 99.5 mol%, respectively. The feasibility and microscopic mechanism of the extraction and separation of n-hexane + DCE by LTTMs were investigated using a combination of experiments and simulations, which provided a methodological reference for the separation of n-hexane + DCE.",

This study identified that the usage of reactive dyes is generating a huge amount of waste products that are contaminating the environment. Hence, this study introduces salt-free reactive dyes that can be used on cotton and would not contribute to ecological contamination. The prime purpose of this study was to explore a promising approach to reduce the cost of the dying process. Therefore, this study proposed the fiber modification technique based on chitosan and 1,2 dichloroethane as a proposed method for dying cotton, which will eventually help in reducing disposal and hazardous waste generated by salt-based chemicals. When the fabric is subjected to a treatment involving polyacrylamide, it causes cellulose to exhibit the main characteristics of wool. As a result, cotton can be dyed using reactive dyes under neutral pH conditions, without the need for electrolyte and alkali. Similarly, when fabric is treated with an emulsion of 1,2 dichloroethane followed by amination with sodium hydroxide, the treatment was discovered to enhance color ﬁxation also. The modification was investigated through in-depth analysis in this research.",

Based on the XRD and TEM results, the CeO2 nanodots were highly dispersed on the porous silica matrix. The characterizations including O2-TPD, XPS, and NH3-TPD clarified that CeO2@SiO2-T catalysts possessed strong acidity, rich surface adsorbed oxygen species and oxygen mobility, which was beneficial to the improvement of adsorption and catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). The CeO2@SiO2-T catalysts exhibited high performance for DCE oxidation, in which the CeO2@SiO2-400 catalyst showed the best performance (T90 = 275 °C at a space velocity of 15000 h−1) and good stability (at 295 °C for 100 h). The characterization and activity test results showed that the richer acid sites were beneficial to the adsorption and activation of DCE, contributing to the subsequent HCl removal and vinyl chloride (VC) formation. Noticeably, the weak acid sites were more favorable for the improvement of catalytic activity. Then major of VC would be oxidized to adsorbed acetate, which could be further decomposed to COx and HCl. In addition, trace poly-chlorinated by-products were detected. The abundant surface adsorbed oxygen species and excellent oxygen mobility facilitated the further oxidation rather than the chlorination reactions.",

In this study, we present measurements of atmospheric dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), tetrachloroethene (C2Cl4), chloroform (CHCl3), and 1,2‐dichloroethane (1,2‐DCA) obtained during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) global‐scale aircraft mission (2016–2018), and use the Community Earth System Model (CESM) updated with recent chlorine chemistry to further investigate their global tropospheric distribution. The measured global average Cl‐VSLS mixing ratios, from 0.2 to 13 km altitude, were 46.6 ppt (CH2Cl2), 9.6 ppt (CHCl3), 7.8 ppt (1,2‐DCA), and 0.84 ppt (C2Cl4) measured by the NSF NCAR Trace Organic Analyzer (TOGA) during ATom. Both measurements and model show distinct hemispheric gradients with the mean measured Northern to Southern Hemisphere (NH/SH) ratio of 2 or greater for all four Cl‐VSLS. In addition, the TOGA profiles over the NH mid‐latitudes showed general enhancements in the Pacific basin compared to the Atlantic basin, with up to ∼18 ppt difference for CH2Cl2 in the mid troposphere. We tagged regional source emissions of CH2Cl2 and C2Cl4 in the model and found that Asian emissions dominate the global distributions of these species both at the surface (950 hPa) and at high altitudes (150 hPa). Overall, our results confirm relatively high mixing ratios of Cl‐VSLS in the UTLS region and show that the CESM model does a reasonable job of simulating their global abundance but we also note the uncertainties with Cl‐VSLS emissions and active chlorine sources in the model. These findings will be used to validate future emission inventories and to investigate the fast convective transport of Cl‐VSLS to the UTLS region and their impact on stratospheric ozone.",

There are several novel findings in the current study. First, combined treatment of mice with 1,2-DCE and high-dose ethanol could synergistically upregulate both protein and mRNA levels of CYP2E1, which might aggravate liver damage through CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress. Second, the combined treatment could also synergistically trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory responses in the liver. Third, the combined treatment synergistically upregulated the antioxidant defence systems in response to oxidative stress, however the compensatory mechanisms of antioxidant defence systems appeared to be insufficient to protect liver damage in the mice.

The application of the concept of the self-assembly for controlling the aggregation of nanographenes (NGs) is challenging.

The former group secures the affinity of NGs for organic solvents, and the latter group drives the 1D arrangement of NGs through the interactions between the TPIB units. The concentration-dependent and temperature variable 1 H NMR, UV-vis, and PL spectra demonstrate the aggregation of NGs in 1,2-dichloroethane, and the aggregation is controllable by the regulation of the solvent polarity. AFM images give the stacked structures of the NGs, and these aggregates turn out to be network polymeric structures at a high concentration.

    "year": 2018,
    "abstract": "Significance The goal of rational computer-aided enzyme design is hampered by the lack of knowledge of the maximum possible rate enhancement. We address this problem by considering the enzyme DhlA, which is naturally adapted for the degradation of dihalogenated ethanes. Using empirical valence bond calculations, we determine the effect of finding mutations that reduce the catalysis and then introducing mutations that restore catalysis. One of our predicted cycles is confirmed experimentally, while the other attempt remains inconclusive. We believe that the proposed strategy provides a very powerful way of validating and refining approaches for computational enzyme design. Rational enzyme design presents a major challenge that has not been overcome by computational approaches. One of the key challenges is the difficulty in assessing the magnitude of the maximum possible catalytic activity. In an attempt to overcome this challenge, we introduce a strategy that takes an active enzyme (assuming that its activity is close to the maximum possible activity), design mutations that reduce the catalytic activity, and then try to restore that catalysis by mutating other residues. Here we take as a test case the enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase (DhlA), with a 1,2-dichloroethane substrate. We start by demonstrating our ability to reproduce the results of single mutations. Next, we design mutations that reduce the enzyme activity and finally design double mutations that are aimed at restoring the activity. Using the computational predictions as a guide, we conduct an experimental study that confirms our prediction in one case and leads to inconclusive results in another case with 1,2-dichloroethane as substrate. Interestingly, one of our predicted double mutants catalyzes dehalogenation of 1,2-dibromoethane more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Trace detection is critical for identifying chemicals that would otherwise remain undetectable. While analytical techniques, such as spectroscopy, spectrometry, and electrochemical sensors, are effective at detecting low concentrations, achieving attomolar sensitivity remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an electroanalytical approach that leverages partitioning kinetics to detect attomolar concentrations of redox-active analytes. Using (Cp*)2FeII as a model system, we demonstrate trace-level detection by facilitating the transfer of (Cp*)2FeII from the bulk aqueous phase into 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) microdroplets positioned atop a gold microelectrode (radius ∼6.25 μm). This partitioning arises from the greater solubility of (Cp*)2FeII in DCE relative to its limited solubility in water, enriching the analyte concentration near the electrode as the microdroplets slowly dissolve into the aqueous phase. Additionally, we explored the role of oxygen in enhancing the electrochemical response: oxygen removal hindered detection at 1 aM, while oxygen saturation significantly amplified the redox peak signal. These findings underscore oxygen's role, which is likely a bimolecular reaction between oxygen and (Cp*)2FeII in signal amplification. An EC’ catalytic mechanism likely amplifies the electrochemical signal of (Cp*)2FeII when the droplet is sufficiently small for feedback to occur, enabling attomolar detection of (Cp*)2FeII. This study introduces a partitioning-based electroanalytical strategy taking advantage of an an EC’ catalytic mechanism for ultra-low detection limits, offering promising applications in trace chemical analysis and advanced sensor technologies.",

In an effort to resolve the technical demerits of the conventional Fenton reaction, particular concern on the use of CaO2-based Fenton reaction was paid in this study. To realize the practical use of CaO2 in the Fenton reaction for groundwater remediation, it could be of great importance to control its reaction rate in the subsurface. As such, this study laid great emphasis on the combined process of electrochemical oxidation and CaO2-based Fenton oxidation, using 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) as a model compound. It was hypothesized that the reaction rate is also highly contingent on the formation of Fe(II) (stemmed from iron anode oxidation). Eighty percent of 1,2-DCA were degraded by the CaO2-based Fenton reaction. The final pH was neutral, inferring that the reaction could be a viable option for the subsurface environment. Moreover, the supply of electric current in an iron anode expedited 1,2-DCA degradation efficiency from 35 % to 62 % via electrically generated Fe(II), which donated electrons to H2O2, producing more hydroxyl radicals. An anode-cathode configuration from the single-well system enhanced the degradation of 1,2-DCA, with less amount of energy consumption than the double-well system. Based on results, CaO2-based electro-Fenton oxidation can remove well 1,2-DCA in groundwater and can be a strategic measure for groundwater remediation.",

    "abstract": "Reductive dehalogenases (RDases) of organohalide‐respiring bacteria are cobamide‐containing iron–sulfur proteins that catalyze different reductive dehalogenation reactions. Here, we report a functional analysis of two recombinant RDases, the tetrachloroethene (PCE) reductive dehalogenase (PceA) of Desulfitobacterium hafniense Y51 and the 1,2‐dichloroethane (1,2‐DCA) reductive dehalogenase (DcaA) of Desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans DCA1. Both enzymes share 88% protein sequence identity, but appeared to have divergent mechanisms. In this study, the heterologously produced DcaA converted 1,2‐DCA and 1,1,2‐trichloroethane (1,1,2‐TCA) via dihaloelimination to ethene and vinyl chloride, respectively. In addition, halogen substitution at PCE, trichloroethene (TCE) and tribromoethene (TBE) was observed, but only at low rates. In contrast, recombinant PceA exclusively converted halogenated ethenes and showed no dihaloelimination activity. In silico structural analysis of both RDases revealed similar architectures of their active site cavities. Exchange of the highly conserved Tyr298 to Phe led to a complete loss of the PCE, TCE and TBE conversion by both RDases, strengthening the assumption that Tyr298 functions as proton donor in the course of halogen substitution. The exchange did not affect the ability of DcaA to convert 1,2‐DCA and 1,1,2‐TCA. This result makes the involvement of a proton transfer in the dihaloelimination reaction unlikely and allows for a clear differentiation between two mechanisms working in DcaA and PceA. The analysis of the role of the active site structure for RDase function was extended to the mutations W118F that had a negative effect on DcaA function and W432F or T294V that caused alterations in the substrate specificity of the enzyme.EnzymesTetrachloroethene reductive dehalogenase (EC 1.21.99.5), DCA ‐RDase.",

At pilot scale, enrichments of 13.5‰ and 6.3‰ for δ13C and δ37Cl, respectively, high levels of reductive dehalogenase (rdh group VI) along with the dominance of Geobacter spp. indicated the occurrence of significant dichloroelimination processes in groundwater under anaerobic conditions. By using the site-specific enrichment factors, degradation extents over approximately 70–80% were estimated, highlighting the relevant potential of NA in 1,2-DCA degradation in the vicinity of the source area at the site.

Although the introduction of metal species into the cavity was attempted in aqueous media using the K+/Li+ salt of P8W48, we encountered several challenges: excess metal species are required, and K+ and/or Li+ remain in the cavity. Therefore, controlling the number and arrangement of the introduced metal species proved difficult. In this study, we overcame the aforementioned problems by developing a novel method for introducing metal species in organic media by employing the organic-solvent-soluble tetra- n-butylammonium (TBA) salt of P8W48 (I, TBA12H28[P8W48O184]·30H2O).

Single crystals (I', TBA14H26[P8W48O184]·20H2O·2CH3NO2) were obtained by recrystallizing I from a nitromethane/toluene mixture in the presence of excess TBAOH.

    "abstract": "AbstractIon transfer across the interface between two immiscible electrolytes can produce a Faraday current involving non‐redox reactions, which is useful for both ion detection and phase‐transfer catalysis. To decrease the transfer energy and improve the selectivity, artificial ligands are needed, which are usually unavailable because of the difficulty in the synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate that the solvation effect can act as the driving force for ion transfer across the micropipette‐supported water/1,2‐dichloroethane interface, including the anions SO42−, NO3−, NO2−, CO32−, and so forth. The thermodynamic properties are discussed, including the diffusion coefficients, Gibbs energy of ion transfer, stoichiometric ratios, and apparent association constants. Meanwhile, the research also provides a method to investigate the solvation effect.",

The PHB content in the obtained PUs was adjusted from 0 to 60.0 wt%. The synthesis was carried out by one pot solution polymerization. PUs nanocomposites loaded with different contents of cloisite®25A (C25A) were prepared by means of in situ solution polymerization. The molecular structure of the obtained PUs was confirmed by FT-IR. The thermal properties of the neat PUs and the resulting nanocomposites were investigated using DSC and TGA. It was found that the cold crystallization of the PHB component was enhanced, while its melt crystallization was retarded with increasing its own content in the PUs. The incorporated C25A in the PU matrix shifted the cold crystallization peak to higher temperature. TGA studies reveal that neat PUs and nanocomposites exhibited three main decompositions steps. The thermal stability of the neat PUs decreased with increasing the PHB content and increased with increasing the C25A content. Tensile mechanical testing revealed that increasing the content of the PHB and C25A made the PUs rigid and strong. The elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the neat PUs were found to increase with increasing the PHB content and enhanced with incorporation of C25A, while the elongation decreased with increasing the PHB and C25A content.

To understand this characteristic feature of DFP, energy decomposition analyses have been performed for the hypothetical transfer of ions at the DFP/DCE interface.

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Vapor intrusion (VI) involves migration of volatile contaminants from subsurface through unsaturated soil into overlying buildings. In 2015, the US EPA recommended an approach for screening VI risks associated with gasoline releases from underground storage tank (UST) sites. Additional assessment of the VI risk from petroleum hydrocarbons was deemed unnecessary for buildings separated from vapor sources by more than recommended vertical screening distances. However, these vertical screening distances did not apply to potential VI risks associated with releases of former leaded gasoline containing 1,2‐dichloroethane (1,2‐DCA), because of a lack of empirical data on the attenuation of 1,2‐DCA in soil gas. This study empirically evaluated 144 paired measurements of 1,2‐DCA concentrations in soil gas and groundwater collected at 47 petroleum UST sites combined with BioVapor modeling. This included (1) assessing the frequency of 1,2‐DCA detections in soil gas below 10−6 risk‐based screening levels at different vertical separation distances and (2) comparing the US EPA recommended vertical screening distances with those predicted by BioVapor modeling. Vertical screening distances were predicted for different soil types using aerobic biodegradation rate constants estimated from the measured soil‐gas data combined with conservative estimates of source concentrations. The modeling indicates that the vertical screening distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) recommended for dissolved‐phase sources is applicable for 1,2‐DCA below certain threshold concentrations in groundwater, while 15 feet (4.6 m) recommended for light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) sources is applicable for sites with clay and loam soils in the vadose zone, but not sand, if 1,2‐DCA concentrations in groundwater exceed 150 μg/L. This dependence of the predicted vertical screening distances on soil type places added emphasis on proper soil characterization for VI screening at sites with 1,2‐DCA sources. The soil‐gas data suggests that a vertical screening distance of 15 feet (4.6 m) is necessary for both dissolved‐phase and LNAPL sources.",

This study developed catalysts containing abundant CeOCu bonds anchored on titanium nanotubes (TNTs) to form strong electronic metal–metal interaction (EMMI) coordination structure for efficiently catalytic ozonation of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). The occurrence of EMMI resulted in the formation of electron-poor/rich centers and a high proportion of weak-acidity sites over Ce-Cu/TNTs catalysts. Among various catalysts, 1Ce1Cu/TNTs exhibited the optimum catalytic performance with 92.5 % of 1,2-DCE conversion and 85.4 % of CO2 selectivity, the long-term stability of 24 h and the good water resistance to 50 % relative humidity (RH). Importantly, the XPS results and DFT calculations suggested Ce drove the Cl atom off Cu species, thus alleviating the chloridion deposit on Cu sites, accelerating the migration of chlorine and offering more redox sites for O3 activation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching tests identified that •OH was a key reactive oxygen species to achieve efficient degradation of 1,2-DCE.

    "abstract": "This work comprehensively investigated the constituents, sources, and associated health risks of ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sampled during the autumn of 2020 in urban Nanjing, a megacity in the densely populated Yangtze River Delta region in China. The total VOC (TVOC, sum of 108 species) concentration was determined to be 29.04 ± 14.89 ppb, and it was consisted of alkanes (36.9%), oxygenated VOCs (19.9%), halogens (19.1%), aromatics (9.9%), alkenes (8.9%), alkynes (4.9%), and others (0.4%). The mean TVOC/NOx (ppbC/ppbv) ratio was only 3.32, indicating the ozone control is overall VOC-limited. In terms of the ozone formation potential (OFP), however, the largest contributor became aromatics (41.9%), followed by alkenes (27.6%), and alkanes (16.9%); aromatics were also the dominant species in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, indicative of the critical importance of aromatics reduction to the coordinated control of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Mass ratios of ethylbenzene/xylene (E/X), isopentane/n-−pentane (I/N), and toluene/benzene (T/B) ratios all pointed to the significant influence of traffic on VOCs. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) revealed five sources showing that traffic was the largest contributor (29.2%), particularly in the morning. A biogenic source, however, became the most important source in the afternoon (31.3%). The calculated noncarcinogenic risk (NCR) and lifetime carcinogenic risk (LCR) of the VOCs were low, but four species, acrolein, benzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and 1,2-dibromoethane, were found to possess risks exceeding the thresholds. Furthermore, we conducted a multilinear regression to apportion the health risks to the PMF-resolved sources. Results show that the biogenic source instead of traffic became the most prominent contributor to the TVOC NCR and its contribution in the afternoon even outpaced the sum of all other sources. In summary, our analysis reveals the priority of controls of aromatics and traffic/industrial emissions to the efficient coreduction of O3 and PM2.5; our analysis also underscores that biogenic emissions should be paid special attention if considering the direct health risks of VOCs.",

After chemical functionalization by different solvents, namely N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), acetonitrile (AC), and 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCE), the four-probe in-plane electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements indicate a simultaneous increase of the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. The observed effect is more pronounced for solvents with a high boiling point, such as N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), than in acetonitrile (AC) and 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCE). We identified the origin of these changes using Hall mobility measurements, which demonstrate enhancement of the PC70BM charge carrier mobility upon addition of the corresponding solvents due to the improved packaging of the fullerene compound and chemical interaction with entrapped solvent molecules within the layers.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Ozone (O3) is a crucial atmospheric component that significantly affects air quality and poses considerable health risks to humans. In the coastal areas of the Yangtze River Delta, typhoons, influenced by the subtropical high-pressure system, can lead to complex ozone pollution situations. This study aimed to explore the causes, sources, and health risks of O3 pollution during such events. Ground-based data from Jiaxing City’s key ozone precursor (VOCs) composition observations, ERA5 reanalysis data, and models CMAQ-ISAM and PMF were employed. Focusing on the severe ozone pollution event in Jiaxing from 3 to 11 September 2022, the results showed that local ozone production was the main contributor (60.8–81.4%, with an average of 72.3%), while external regional transport was secondary. Concentrations of olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons increased remarkably, playing a vital role in ozone formation. Meteorological conditions, such as reduced cloud cover during typhoon periphery transit, promoted ozone accumulation. By considering the unique respiratory exposure habits of the Chinese population, refined health risk assessments were conducted. Acrolein was found to be the main cause of chronic non-carcinogenic risks (NCRs), with NCR values reaching 1.74 and 2.02 during and after pollution. In lifetime carcinogenic risk (LCR) assessment, the mid-pollution LCR was 1.73 times higher, mainly due to 1,2-dichloroethane and benzene. This study presents a methodology that is readily adaptable to analogous pollution incidents, thereby providing a pragmatic framework to guide actionable local government policy-making aimed at safeguarding public health and mitigating urban ozone pollution.",

Batch cultivation on waste glycerol showed accumulation of 6.76 g L–1 biomass containing 4.84 g L–1 poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) copolymer with 3-hydroxyvalerate content of 24.6 mol%. A novel recovery strategy was developed for the extraction of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) copolymer from Cupriavidus necator using recyclable solvents, i.e., propylene carbonate, butyl acetate, isoamyl alcohol, and ethyl acetate. Propylene carbonate demonstrated the recovery efficiency of 90 % and polymer purity of 95 %, at 120 °C after 30 min. Ethyl acetate exhibited a higher efficiency than butyl acetate in terms of recovering the copolymer from cells. Ethyl acetate extraction demonstrated a recovery yield of 96 % and purity of 93 % at 100 °C. Efficacy of an anionic surfactant, linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acid (LAS), was also tested for extraction, and it showed maximum yield of 84 % and purity of 90 % at 80 °C and pH 5.0. Extraction of copolymer using these solvents could help in replacing generally used chlorinated toxic solvents, such as 1,2 dichloroethane and chloroform. Further, GPC, TGA and DSC analysis revealed that the thermo-physical properties were not significantly affected by the extraction method. However, the molecular weight distribution of the polymer showed a variation depending on the type of solvent used for extraction. Subsequently, endotoxins were removed efficiently to less than 5 EU g–1 of copolymer using alkali at optimized conditions of 6 h digestion time and 2.5 N NaOH concentration for medical applications.",

Herein, we fabricated a functional MLA with underwater anti-oil and self-cleaning abilities by combining the femtosecond laser wet etching (FLWE) and the femtosecond laser direct writing (FLDW) techniques. The as-prepared close-packed MLA is composed of 10000 single microlenses with the aperture diameter of 50 µm. The surface of each microlens is further textured with micro/nanoparticles. Clear and uniform images could be captured by using the resultant MLA in water, demonstrating great underwater imaging ability. The modulation transfer function value is larger than 0.6 at 55 lp/mm. In addition, the micro/nanostructures endow the as-fabricated MLA surface with underwater superoleophobicity and oil-repellent performance. Various oils can be repelled by the resultant MLA in water. Underwater 1,2-dichloroethane oil droplet on the textured MLA has a contact angle of 158.0 ± 0.5° and a sliding angle of 2.0 ± 0.2°.

However, unraveling microbial interactions as well as utilization of substrate involved in complex microbial communities is a challenging task. Hence, we demonstrate an integrated approach of shotgun metagenomics and whole genome sequencing to identify the microbial diversity and genes involved in degradation of benzoate, 1,2-dichloroethane and phenylalanine metabolism and degradation pathways from CETP microbiome.Results: The taxonomy profile was annotated using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database in the MG-RAST server. The results showed that, bacteria accounted for 98.46% was the most abundant domain, followed by Eukaryota (0.10%) and Archea 0.02%. At Phylum level, Proteobacteria (28.8%) were dominant, followed by Bacteroidetes (16.1%), Firmicutes (11.7%) and Fusobacteria (6.9%). The most dominated species were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Wolinella succinogenes, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Desulfovibris vulgaris, Clostridium sticklandii, and Escherichia coli. The Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, revealed the presence of the genes responsible for the metabolism and degradation of aromatic compounds. This information was validated with the whole genome analysis of the bacteria isolated from the CETP.Conclusion: The two type of integrated meta omics analyses revealed that the metabolic and degradation capability at both community wide and individual bacterial levels. In addition, we demonstrated that microbial diversity changes with the treatment process in which inlet of CETP effluent shows higher dominancy of Proteobacteria whereas in textile industry outlet the high abundance of Firmicutes was observed. We foresee this approach would contribute in designing the bioremediation strategies for the industrial treatment process.",

DCE readily reacts with alcohols in a superbasic system to afford various vinyloxyalkanes and their derivatives in good yields.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms of brain damage induced by the combined treatment of mice with 1,2‐dichloroethane (1,2‐DCE) and ethanol. Mice were divided into control group; 1,2‐DCE‐intoxicated group; ethanol‐treated group; and low‐, medium‐, and high‐dose combined treatment groups. Histological observations along with brain organ coefficients and water content were used to measure the brain damage directly and indirectly. The levels of nonprotein sulfhydryls, malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase activity were used as parameters to evaluate oxidative stress in the brain. Protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), zonula occludens‐1 (occludin and zo‐1), aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase (HO)‐1, and the γ‐glutamyl cysteine synthetase catalytic and modulatory subunits (γ‐GCSc, GR, and γ‐GCSm) in the brain were examined by Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, respectively. Effects of the combined treatment of 1,2‐DCE and ethanol were evaluated by analysis of variance with a factorial design. The results suggested that combined exposure to ethanol and 1,2‐DCE synergistically increased CYP2E1 protein and mRNA levels, accelerated the metabolism of ethanol and 1,2‐DCE in the brain tissue, induced high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased MDA levels, thereby damaging the blood‐brain barrier and causing obvious pathological changes in brain tissue. However, the increased level of ROS activated the Nrf2 signal transduction pathway, promoting the expression of HO‐1 and glutathione‐related antioxidant enzymes in the brain to protect the cells from oxidative damage.",

We describe the observation and quantification of immiscible solvent entrapment on a carbonaceous electrode surface using microscopy-coupled electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL). As aqueous microdroplets suspended in 1,2-dichloroethane collide with a glassy carbon electrode surface, small volumes of the solvent become entrapped between the electrode and aqueous phase, resulting in an overestimation of the true microdroplet/electrode contact area. To quantify the contribution of solvent entrapment decreasing the microdroplet contact area, we drive an ECL reaction within the microdroplet phase using tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride ([Ru(bpy)3]Cl2) as the ECL luminophore and sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4) as the co-reactant. Importantly, the hydrophilicity of sodium oxalate ensures that the reaction proceeds in the aqueous phase, permitting a clear contrast between the aqueous and 1,2-dichloroethane present at the electrode interface. With the contrast provided by ECL imaging, we quantify the microdroplet radius, apparent microdroplet contact area (aqueous + entrapped 1,2-dichloroethane), entrapped solvent contact area, and the number of entrapped solvent pockets per droplet.

    "abstract": "ConspectusThe global plastic waste crisis, driven by exponential growth in plastic production, has necessitated the development of innovative approaches for recycling and upcycling. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), one of the most widely used polyesters, poses significant environmental challenges due to its chemical stability and non-degradable nature. While existing methodologies have made significant contributions to the recycling of PET waste through mechanical or chemical processes, an emerging strategy of upcycling PET into high-value products may offer greater potential to present significant advantages in economic feasibility and long-term sustainability. Over the past ten years, hundreds of publications have explored the upcycling of PET in the laboratory through catalytic reactions with various co-reactants, primarily water, hydroxides, alcohols, and amines. In this Account, we summarize our contributions on the design of novel catalytic strategies for the upcycling of PET along with other problematic wastes and H2. For instance, we explored the co-upcycling of PET with other plastics such as poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and polyoxymethylene (POM), demonstrating how the chlorine from PVC could be utilized to depolymerize PET into terephthalic acid (TPA) and 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC) and how the formaldehyde derived from POM could be converted into 1,3-dioxolane through the condensation reaction with ethylene glycol (EG) derived from PET. We also developed a one-pot catalytic system that simultaneously hydrogenated PET and CO2 into high-value chemicals, leveraging a dual-promotion effect on both CO2 hydrogenation and PET methanolysis and achieving high yields of EG, dimethyl cyclohexanedicarboxylate (DMCD) and p-xylene (PX). A H2-free, one-pot, two-step catalytic process was further presented to upcycle PET with CO2, yielding formic acid (FA) and TPA. Moreover, we demonstrated a direct hydrogenation strategy to convert PET into a degradable polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate)-poly(ethylene-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate) (PET-PECHD), through controlled hydrogenation of its aromatic rings, which preserved the polymer's mechanical and thermal properties while introducing degradability, offering a sustainable alternative for packaging materials.Our research highlights the importance of catalyst design, reaction engineering, and process optimization in achieving efficient and scalable PET upcycling processes. By integrating multiple catalytic steps and leveraging waste-derived resources, we outline a roadmap for the near future of PET upcycling, aiming to enable breakthroughs in real-life plastic upcycling.",

    "year": 2016,
    "abstract": "Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for animals and humans because it functions as an antioxidant and catalyst for the production of active thyroid hormone. However, higher intake of Se can cause disease and death to humans. This study investigates the removal of inorganic Se (selenite, Se (IV)) from contaminated water which is known as less bioavailable and more toxic than organic forms. Several technologies exist for Se removal such as lime neutralization, bacterial reduction, ion exchange membranes, electrocoagulation, sorption, and hybrid processes such as coagulation/filtration. However, these techniques were demonstrated to be effective only at low Se concentrations levels (below 5 mg/L). This study employs an advanced reduction process (ARP) that combines a reducing agent and an activation method and investigates its applicability for Se removal at high concentrations (∼10 mg/L).The goal of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of ARP for reducing Se (IV) to elemental Se or stable solids composing of Se and S (e.g. SeS or SeS2) in water using a combination of dithionite or sulfide as reducing agents and UV light as an activating method. Three different UV light sources including monochromatic 254 nm UV-L, UV-M with primary energy peak at 365 nm, and 312 nm UV-B were evaluated. This work studied the effects of operating conditions such as concentrations of reducing agents, solution pH, and initial selenium concentration for the optimum combination that achieves the efficient reduction of Se (IV).In industrial applications, sulfur dioxide has been used as the reactant to reduce Se (IV) to elemental Se, but it was reported that SO2 was ineffective for Se (IV) reduction for waters with low Se concentration at room temperature. In this study, sodium dithionite and sodium sulfide were used as a strong reducing agent of interest. Sodium dithionite was proven to be an effective reductant and produce active reducing radicals when activated by UV light. It has been shown to be very effective in reducing chlorate, trichloroethylene or 1,2-dichloroethane in our earlier studies. It is known that dithionite undergoes decomposition reactions which is strongly dependent on the pH and is rapid in the acidic environment and its major decomposition products are thiosulfate (S2O3\n2–) and bisulfite (HSO3–). Decomposition reaction is very complicated because its reaction products can decompose and interact with each other and can be activated by UV irradiation at various rates, which will result in the production of elemental sulfur or selenium, or precipitates of Se-S at different stages. In Se-S solution, the compounds having a general formula, SeSn (n:1–7) can be produced and it can form crystalline or amorphous composition. Therefore, we investigated the chemistry of dithionite and sulfide in Se-S water system and the behavior Se removal under UV irradiation.Screening tests of various combinations of reducing agents and UV light types showed that the greatest Se removal (86.4%) was found with dithionite irradiated by UV-L lamp (254 nm) at around pH 5. Sulfide as a reducing reagent at neutral pH resulted in selenium removal percentages of 83.5% and 92.5% without and with UV-L irradiation, respectively. Maximum removal efficiency of Se was observed when sulfide or dithionite molar concentration was 40 times the initial Se molar concentration under UV light at given conditions. A typical color of the Se-dithionite mixture solution was milky yellow during UV-L irradiation.Yellow-colored solids were precipitated. The combination of dithionite and UV-B (major peak at 312 nm) showed orange-colored solid in 3 hours of irradiation. It is expected that dithionite or dithionite decomposition products will produce active radicals dependent on UV light types, which may change Se-S solid chemistry. To investigate surface chemistry of solids and sulfur-containing species, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS) were utilized. Also, incremental reducing agent solution injection or electrocoagulation method was utilized to reduce final Se concentration to below the maximum contaminant level.",

However, traditional remediation methods are inefficient and costly, while bioremediation presents a green, efficient, and non-secondary polluting alternative. In this study, an engineered strain capable of completely degrading 1,2-DCA was constructed. We introduced six exogenous genes of the 1,2-DCA degradation pathway into E. coli and confirmed their normal transcription and efficient expression in this engineered strain through qRT-PCR and proteomics. The degradation experiments showed that the strain completely degraded 2 mM 1,2-DCA within 12 h. Furthermore, the results of isotope tracing verified that the final degradation product, malic acid, entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) of E. coli and was ultimately fully metabolized. Also, morphological changes in the engineered strain and control strain exposed to 1,2-DCA were observed under SEM, and the results revealed that the engineered strain is more tolerant to 1,2-DCA than the control strain.

The catalytic performance, in particular the selectivities of the catalysts was examined on hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane. Two supported monometallic catalysts (Ag/ZrO2 and Pd/ZrO2) were included as comparative catalysts. Ag/ZrO2 exhibited a low 1,2-dichloroethane coversion and high chloroethylene selectivity for the gas-phase hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane, while Pd/ZrO2 had a high conversion and ethane selectivity. In contrast to monometallic catalysts, Ag-Pd/ZrO2 with trace Pd had substantially enhanced ethylene selectivity, and the bimetallic catalyst with a Pd loading amount of 0.099wt.% (denoted as Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2) exhibited nearly 100% ethylene selectivity. The excellent ethylene selectivity can be attributed to the highly dispersed metallic Pd in Ag particles of Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 as evidenced by the IR spectra of CO adsorption.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Unlike with the energy, which is a scalar property, machine learning (ML) prediction of vector or tensor properties poses the additional challenge of achieving proper invariance (covariance) with respect to molecular rotation. For the energy gradients needed in molecular dynamics (MD), this symmetry is automatically fulfilled when taking analytic derivative of the energy, which is a scalar invariant (using properly invariant molecular descriptors). However, if the properties cannot be obtained by differentiation, other appropriate methods should be applied to retain the covariance. Several approaches have been suggested to properly treat this issue. For nonadiabatic couplings and polarizabilities, for example, it was possible to construct virtual quantities from which the above tensorial properties are obtained by differentiation and thus guarantee the covariance. Another possible solution is to build the rotational equivariance into the design of a neural network employed in the model. Here, we propose a simpler alternative technique, which does not require construction of auxiliary properties or application of special equivariant ML techniques. We suggest a three-step approach, using the molecular tensor of inertia. In the first step, the molecule is rotated using the eigenvectors of this tensor to its principal axes. In the second step, the ML procedure predicts the vector property relative to this orientation, based on a training set where all vector properties were in this same coordinate system. As the third step, it remains to transform the ML estimate of the vector property back to the original orientation. This rotate-predict-rotate (RPR) procedure should thus guarantee proper covariance of a vector property and is trivially extensible also to tensors such as polarizability. The RPR procedure has an advantage that the accurate models can be trained very fast for thousands of molecular configurations, which might be beneficial where many training sets are required (e.g., in active learning). We have implemented the RPR technique, using the MLatom and Newton-X programs for ML and MD, and performed its assessment on the dipole moment along MD trajectories of 1,2-dichloroethane.",

VOC concentrations were measured in urban, industrial, and long-range transport scenarios using proton transfer reaction-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography–MS with canister sampling. The results demonstrate that benzene shows significant vertical and spatial dispersion during long-range transport due to its intermediate atmospheric lifetime, which allows it to persist and impact downwind air quality. Additionally, Chlorinated VOCs, such as 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, display transport behaviors. Their relatively consistent concentrations during long-range transport emphasize the influence of industrial activities, including coal combustion and petrochemical processes, as major sources. Elevated levels of chlorinated VOCs were primarily associated with emissions from industrial regions in Chungnam, while aromatic VOCs were predominantly linked to urban traffic emissions. These findings underscore the need for international cooperation to combat transboundary pollution and highlight the importance of comprehensive air quality management strategies that address both urban and industrial emission sources.

Protein and mRNA levels of MMP-2, and the phosphorylated protein levels of p38 MAPK (p-p38), extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (p-ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK1/2) in astrocytes were examined by immunostaining, western blot or real-time RT-PCR analysis. Findings from this study disclosed that protein levels of MMP-2 were upregulated by 2-CE in astrocytes. Meanwhile, protein levels of p-p38, p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK1/2 were also increased apparently in the cells treated with 2-CE. Moreover, pretreatment of astrocytes with SB202190 (inhibitor of p38 MAPK), U0126 (inhibitor of ERK1/2) or SP600125 (inhibitor of JNK1/2) could suppress the upregulated expression of p-p38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK1/2. In response to suppressed protein levels of p-p38 and p-JNK1/2, the protein levels of MMP-2 also decreased significantly, indicating that activation of MAPK signal pathways were involved in the mechanisms underlying 2-CE-induced upregulation of MMP-2 expression.",

    "abstract": "Designing transition metal composite oxide catalysts with high catalytic performance and stability in the catalytic oxidation of CVOCs is still a big challenge, especially by economic and convenient methods. To realize this, highly dispersed MnCoOx nanoparticles were prepared on the HZSM-5 to synthesize MnyCozOx/H5-50 catalyst and applied in the catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). The T90 of Mn1Co1Ox/H5-50 (215 °C) decreased by 53 and 45 °C compared with Mn2O3/H5-50 and Co3O4/H5-50, respectively. The outstanding catalytic activity and thermal stability of Mn1Co1Ox/H5-50 are attributed to the abundance of Mn4+, Co2+, and adsorbed oxygen, prominent redox ability, and suitable acidity. All of these features originated from the strong interaction in the highly dispersed MnCoOx solid solution. The DFT confirmed that the MnCoOx activated the C-Cl bond to accelerate the occurrence of dechlorination reactions and reduce the formation of intermediate products. In-situ DRIFTS proved that the elimination rate of vinyl alcohol or vinyl chloride intermediate was the key rate-determining step in the reaction process. The prepared Mn1Co1Ox/H5-50 catalyst could precisely achieve this objective at high temperature region and subsequently reduce the production of toxic by-products.

Comparison of benzene outgassing between JP18 and d6-JP-18 exposed to EUV photons and 80 eV electrons. Deuterium labeling confirms that the formation of benzene does not occur through abstraction of a hydrogen from the acetate ligand. J. Photopolym. Sci. Technol., Vol. 30, No. 1, 2017 125 2.4. The role of water The generation of benzene by a single reaction pathway is dependent on the abstraction of a hydrogen from a phenyl ligand within the film. The comparison of JP-18 and d6-JP-18 provided conclusive evidence that benzene formation does not occur via hydrogen abstraction at the acetate, and although the only other source of hydrogen within the resist molecule lays in the phenyl ligand it may not be the only additional source in the film. As no additional components make up the resist formulation the only other possible sources of hydrogen within the film are trace quantities of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) and H2O. The standard spincoating solvent for our antimony carboxylate platform is DCE. Due to its volatility and the low pressures of the outgassing chamber (1E-7 torr) we expect that very little DCE remains within our resist films. Conversely, water has the potential to remain in resist films. DCE has a low water solubility of 0.86% by weight [20], but the large amount of surface area by volume of a resist film and the ability of H2O to hydrogen bond may result in H2O being a source of hydrogen within the film. To determine the presence of water within the film and its ability to participate in the photomechanism, two additional outgassing experiments were performed (1) a comparison of synthetic routes with and without the inclusion of H2O, (2) incorporation of D2O as a formulation additive to monitor d1-benzene formation. JP-18 and d6-JP-18 were synthesized by two routes: one which included the use of H2O2 (30 wt.% in H2O) (S1) and the second excluding H2O (S2) entirely. As a control, both resists, synthesized by each method, were evaluated side-by-side to identify any significant changes in outgassing signature for the mass ranges of benzene and phenol (Figure 11 A and B). The data is plotted as relative outgassing in which the largest peak is normalized to one and the surrounding peaks are scaled accordingly. A comparison of both synthesis methods for the deuterated and non-deuterated complex showed good agreement asserting that the presence of H2O pre-formulation has no effect on outgassing Additionally, this experiment provides further evidence to the previously discussed deuteriumlabelling study in which it was found phenol is generated upon abstraction of a hydrogen from the acetate ligand and benzene is not. Experiment 2 aimed to purposefully dope a resist film with D2O and observe benzene outFig. 11. Outgassing results upon evaluating the synthesis methods to create JP-18 and d6-JP-18 including and excluding H2O. (A) the mass range for benzene, (B) the mass range for phenol. gassing in JP-18. A peak at 79 amu would be indicative of H2O’s ability to participate as a site of hydrogen abstraction. As DCE has poor water solubility additional solvents were added to the resist formulation. Each resist film was monitored by mass spectrometer in the range of 70–100 amu during EUV exposure. Analysis of the compiled data confirmed that none of the formulations regardless of solvent or weight percent of D2O generated a peak of 79 or for that matter of 95 as would be expected if a deuterium atom were abstracted to create benzene or phenol. Additionally, a mass range of 15-25 amu was observed during pump down of the chamber, and upon EUV exposure of each film. No D2O was found leaving the film due to vacuum or exposure. From these experiments, we conclude that water is not a significant source of hydrogen in our system and does not participate in the generation of benzene. 2.5. Mechanistic interpretation Mechanistic interpretation is needed to understand the pathways by which reactions occur and thereby leave a nonvolatile photoproduct. Therefore, we drew from the well-established J. Photopolym. Sci. Technol., Vol. 30, No. 1, 2017 126 literature of electron-induced chemistry from the gas phase [21]. Eight fundamental reactions are known to describe photons and electrons interacting with matter. Of the eight reactions, three are of primary focus for our resist system. The remaining five are either incompatible with thin film EUV chemistry or are subsequent processes of the three reactions of note. Utilizing a basic AB representation for our antimony carboxylate compounds and the simplifying assumption that A is electro-positive and B is electro-negative, we determine the following equations (Eqs. 1-3).

We propose the use of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) as an orthogonal solvent for PTAA HTL, and a triple-layer HTL of [PTAA/TFB/PVK] was successfully realized solely through a solution-process. With an increase in the number of HTLs, there was an observed rise in external quantum efficiency (EQE) and a simultaneous reduction in turn-on voltage (Von) of the PeLED devices, attributed to a gradual decrease in the hole-injection barrier. In addition to the HTL, the integration of a double-layer electron-transporting layer (ETL) of [TPBi/PO-T2T] further enhanced overall device performance, resulting in a maximum EQE over 12 % and a Von as low as 2.22 V. The source of this enhancement was also investigated through time-resolved photoluminescence analysis and single-carrier device characterizations.",

Organic hydrocarbons such as 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) are very stable prepared materials produced as intermediates to obtain polyvinyl chloride, and the prepared photo-catalyst is an innovative method for extreme decomposition of chlorinated hydrocarbons. However, some significant results were obtained using different analysis techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed that the addition of Ag and Cu-NPS partially altered the structure of pure graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4-Pure). Scanning electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the morphological features of Ag-Cu/g-C3N4 contain quantum dots of Ag and Cu nanoparticles in addition to 2d-g-C3N4. The better separation of the photo-generated charge carriers is attributed to better photoactivity in the case of 0.3 g Ag-Cu/g-C3N4 with a reaction time of less than 30 min. Furthermore, the Ag-Cu/g-C3N4 recycling experiment showed that the catalyst remained stable after three stages of the pyrolysis experimental cycle.

The Ru/TiOx catalyst exhibited excellent activity and stability in the oxidation of mixed VOCs and could inhibit the generation of byproducts and Cl2 compared with the Ru/HPW-TiO2 catalyst.

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Anionic surfactants (AS) are becoming a major emerging contaminant of waters due to their widespread use in household and industrial products. The standard chloroform method for analysis of AS in water relies on chloroform extraction of a methylene blue active substance (MBAS), which contains ion pairs between methylene blue (MB) molecules (positively charged) and AS. Due to the poor extractability of chloroform, the procedure is complicated, time-consuming, and subject to anionic interferences. A mixture of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK)–1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) at a 3:1 ratio of MIBK:DCE proved to be a robust solvent for AS extraction for a wide range of samples under various chemical conditions. The objectives of this research were to set the washing protocol to eliminate the anionic interferences in the MIBK-DCE extraction and to develop a new simplified analytical method for AS analysis using the MIBK-DCE (3:1) extractant. The suitability of the proposed MIBK-DCE method was validated based on quality control and assurance criteria, such as selectivity, accuracy, precision, method detection limit (MDL), limit of quantification (LOQ), and sensitivity. Various water samples, such as freshwater, wastewater, and seawater, were used for the method development and validation. Interferences by inorganic and organic anions were evident in the reference chloroform method but were eliminated in the MIBK-DCE procedure with a two-step process that consisted of washing with a carbonate/bicarbonate solution at pH 9.2 and a mixture of silver sulfate (Ag2SO4) and potassium alum (AlK(SO4)2). The simplified MIBK-DCE method for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) analysis consisted of (i) sample pre-treatment, (ii) MIBK-DCE extraction, (iii) washing and filtration, and (iv) absorbance measurement. The MIBK-DCE method was accurate, precise, selective, and sensitive for AS analysis and showed MDL of 0.0001 mg/L, LOQ of 0.0005 mg/L, relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.1%, and recovery of 99.0%. All these criteria were superior to those of the chloroform method. Sensitivity analysis showed highly significant correlations in AS analyses between the MIBK-DCE and chloroform methods for domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater, and seawater. The MIBK-DCE method is simple, rapid, robust, reproducible, and convenient, when compared to the chloroform method. Results demonstrate that the simplified MIBK-DCE method can be employed for AS analysis in a wide range of environmental waters including seawater.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The interfacial behaviour of the amphiphilic drug hexadecyl phosphocholine (HePC, also called miltefosine) was analysed by cyclic voltammetry applied at the water/1,2-dichloroethane interface. HePC is the only oral drug currently approved for the treatment of visceral, mucosal  and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Because of its amphiphilic character, it can interact with biological membranes, solubilizing their compounds and leading to cell disruption. These interactions are responsible for its side effects and toxicity; therefore, HePC quantification in biological fluids and pharmaceutical preparations is extremely important. However, the lack of a chromophore in its structure prevents its spectroscopic determination. For this reason, the main challenge of this work was to propose an electroanalytical method for the quantification of this drug, which constitutes a simpler alternative than liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry already reported. With this aim, in the first part of this work, the mechanism of the electrochemical process occurring after polarizing the interface was studied. By varying the experimental conditions, it was possible to determine that in a first step, at open circuit or at low potential values, HePC spontaneously adsorbed to the interface. Later, as the potential increased, the transfer of the anions present in the organic phase towards the aqueous side of the interface, where the HePC polar head groups were present, occurred thus forming adsorbed \"ion pairs\" and producing an increase in positive current. Subsequently, in the negative sweep, the \"ion pairs\" dissociated and desorbed giving rise to a negative peak. In this way, both negative and positive currents were considered useful for quantitative purposes. In the second part of this work, an appropriate experimental procedure was designed and proposed as a quantitative methodology for the HePC determination, which consisted of cleaning the interface and controlling the time at open circuit, followed by the voltammetric analysis. A linear response of both, positive or negative, peak currents with drug concentration was obtained within an acceptable range, providing a simple solution for the HePC quantification problem. Future studies will be carried out to evaluate the quantification and selectivity in real matrices containing polymer micelles working as HePC nanocarriers with the aim of avoiding the adverse effects of HePC when it is orally or intravenously administered.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Expanding the tunability of metallic nanoparticles in simple and cost-effective manners is essential for developing heterogeneous catalysts needed for the energy conversion systems of the future. Many current methods of switching between different nanoparticle morphologies and compositions include the use of surfactants, pH adjustments or other coreactants. One relatively unexplored and new route to tuning these nanoparticle properties involves taking advantage of the organic phase surrounding the aqueous droplets used in nanodroplet mediated electrodeposition techniques. These aqueous nanodroplets contain metal precursor salts that electrodeposit nanoparticles when they collide with a sufficiently biased electrode. Organic solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane, known to have relatively high dioxygen solubilities compared to water, may provide an oxygen rich environment at the droplet interface, promoting heterogeneous oxygen reduction. In this work, the oxygen reduction reaction is used in the electrodeposition of copper to tune the resulting nanoparticle morphologies and compositions. These effects are also compared to those in bulk aqueous electrodeposition. The properties of the nanoparticles and the role of oxygen reduction in their synthesis are probed through electrochemical techniques, electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When only reducing copper at the electrode, the resulting nanoparticles possess a range of cubic and spherical morphologies and multiple copper oxidation states indicative of zerovalent copper and copper oxide nanoparticles. When reducing both copper and oxygen, the electrodeposited nanoparticles possess a distinctive rod-like morphology with oxidation states and atomic ratios indicative of copper hydroxide. The latter nanoparticle morphology and composition was not attainable when copper was electrodeposited from a bulk aqueous solution at the same applied reducing potential. Our results show that one can take advantage of the fundamental electrochemistry taking place at the aqueous|organic|electrode interface to tune key properties of copper nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) is one of the most abundant manmade chlorinated organic contaminants in the world. Reductive dechlorination of 1,2-DCA by organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) can be impacted by other chlorinated contaminants such as chloroethenes and chloropropanes that can co-exist with 1,2-DCA at contaminated sites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chloroethenes and 1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-DCP) on 1,2-DCA dechlorination using sediment cultures enriched with 1,2-DCA as the sole chlorinated compound (EA culture) or with 1,2-DCA and tetrachloroethene (PCE) (EB culture), and to model dechlorination kinetics. Both cultures contained Dehalococcoides as most predominated OHRB, and Dehalogenimonas and Geobacter as other known OHRB. In sediment-free enrichments obtained from the EA and EB cultures, dechlorination of 1,2-DCA was inhibited in the presence of the same concentrations of either PCE, vinyl chloride (VC), or 1,2-DCP; however, concurrent dechlorination of dual chlorinated compounds was achieved. In contrast, 1,2-DCA dechlorination completely ceased in the presence of cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) and only occurred after cDCE was fully dechlorinated. In turn, 1,2-DCA did not affect dechlorination of PCE, cDCE, VC, and 1,2-DCP. In sediment-free enrichments obtained from the EA culture, Dehalogenimonas 16S rRNA gene copy numbers decreased 1–3 orders of magnitude likely due to an inhibitory effect of chloroethenes. Dechlorination with and without competitive inhibition fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics and confirmed the inhibitory effect of chloroethenes and 1,2-DCP on 1,2-DCA dechlorination. This study reinforces that the type of chlorinated substrate drives the selection of specific OHRB, and indicates that removal of chloroethenes and in particular cDCE might be necessary before effective removal of 1,2-DCA at sites contaminated with mixed chlorinated solvents.",

In pharmacokinetic studies using electrochemical techniques, it is widely used as an organic solvent for dissolving drugs and forms a water/1,2-DCE interface. The 1,2-DCE exposure caused by inadequate protection poses a risk of toxicity via inhalation or dermal contact. This case series documents five instances of poisoning resulting from occupational exposure to industrial products containing 1,2-DCE. 1,2-DCE can induce neurological damage, particularly affecting the central nervous system, manifesting as toxic encephalopathy. Clinical manifestations encompass headache, limb convulsions, and coma, often accompanied by increased intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging aids in the early detection of toxic encephalopathy by revealing extensive cerebral edema and diffuse, symmetrical abnormalities in signal intensity within the bilateral cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, and dentate nucleus. The principal therapeutic strategies encompass the administration of dehydrating agents, glucocorticoids, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Patients with mild poisoning can achieve recovery, whereas those with severe poisoning may experience fatal outcomes. Consequently, effective preventative measures must be instituted to minimize exposure to 1,2-DCE in the workplace.",

From a broad family of flavin derivatives, deazaalloxazines are significantly underdeveloped from the point of view of photophysical properties. Herein, we report photophysics of 5-deazaalloxazine ( 1a ) in water, acetonitrile, and some other solvents. In particular, triplet excited states of 1a in water and in acetonitrile were investigated using ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) transient absorption spectroscopy. The measured triplet lifetimes for 1a were all on the microsecond time scale (≈ 60 μs) in deoxygenated solutions. The quantum yield of S_1 → T_1 intersystem crossing for 1a in water was 0.43 based on T_1 energy transfer from 1a to indicaxanthin ( 5 ) acting as acceptor and on comparative actinometric measurements using benzophenone ( 6 ). 1a was an efficient photosensitizer for singlet oxygen in aerated solutions, with quantum yields of singlet oxygen in methanol of about 0.76, compared to acetonitrile ~ 0.74, dichloromethane ~ 0.64 and 1,2-dichloroethane ~ 0.54. Significantly lower singlet oxygen quantum yields were obtained in water and deuterated water (Ф_Δ ~ 0.42 and 0.44, respectively). Human red blood cells (RBC) were used as a cell model to study the antioxidant capacity in vitro and cytotoxic activity of 1a . Fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) data were analyzed by fluorescence lifetime parameters and distribution for different parts of the emission spectrum. Comparison of multidimensional fluorescent properties of RBC under physiological-like and oxidative-stress conditions in the presence and absence of 1a suggests its dual activity as probe and singlet-oxygen generator and opens up a pathway for using FLIM to analyze complex intracellular behavior of flavin-like compounds. These new data on structure–property relationship contribute to the body of information required for a rational design of flavin-based tools for future biological and biochemical applications.

For most cations, their half-wave potential of transfer shifted toward more negative values, indicating that it is easier to transfer these ions from the aqueous phase with urea to the organic phase, showing that the addition of urea decreases the solvation of ions in the aqueous phase. However, the half-wave potentials for a series of cationic phenothiazine dyes shifted toward more positive potentials, indicating improved solvation in urea solution.

PTB7 showed higher electrical conductivity or Seebeck coefficient (or even both) and, hence, a higher thermoelectric power factor than a variety of organic semiconductors. Therefore, it is worth working more on this semiconductor to improve its thermoelectric figure of merit. In this work, for the first time the effect of cosolvents on the thermoelectric properties of PTB7 is investigated. PTB7 conducting polymer dissolved in chlorobenzene was treated with different solvents: N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), acetonitrile (AC), and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). Upon addition of DMF, DMSO, and NMP, a significant enhancement in the electrical conductivity of the samples accompanied by a reduction in the Seebeck coefficient occurred as a result of doping, while the use of AC and DCE led to simultaneous enhancement in the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient by increasing the mobility. The dopants used in this work are inexpensive, are easily available, and do not need to perform any synthesis process. The highest estimated figure of merit value obtained in this work without optimization is 0.1, which is of the highest values for organic thermoelectric materials.",

The combined system exhibited better adaptability when facing sudden changes in inlet concentrations and empty bed residence time. The presence of catalysts in the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor helped to reduce ozone generation and increase CO2 production and selectivity. Water solubility and degradability of the byproducts were also enhanced by the catalysts in the DBD reactor. Further studies showed that the degradation of 1,2‐dichloroethane and n‐hexane mixed exhaust gases and the re‐acclimation performance after starvation in the combined system were better than those in the single BTF. Analysis of microbial communities showed higher biological diversity and abundance of microbial communities in the single‐BTF system compared with the combined system.CONCLUSIONThe combined system with plasma‐catalysis as pretreatment for the BTF can be used effectively to remove slowly biodegradable pollutants and has better stability and adaptability to changes in experimental conditions. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",
