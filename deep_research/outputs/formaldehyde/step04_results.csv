Strength enhancement and zero formaldehyde film for fibrillation resistance of lyocell knitted fabric via electrostatic self-assembly,10.1016/j.porgcoat.2025.109835,2026,formaldehyde,"The abstract explicitly states that the proposed fibrillation resistance treatment is a 'formaldehyde-free approach,' indicating it avoids formaldehyde use. It presents a method using epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine copolymer (EDC) and polyacrylic acid emulsion (PAE) to form a protective film, which improves fabric properties without formaldehyde emission. This clearly indicates a safer alternative to formaldehyde-based treatments.",epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine copolymer (EDC); polyacrylic acid emulsion (PAE),
Solvent-free synthesis of a formaldehyde-free benzoxazine monomer: Study of its curing acceleration effect for commercial benzoxazine,10.1039/d2py00462c,2022,formaldehyde,"The abstract explicitly mentions the synthesis of a formaldehyde-free benzoxazine monomer, indicating it as an alternative to formaldehyde-containing resins. The term 'formaldehyde-free' implies a safety advantage by avoiding formaldehyde, a known hazardous substance, thus presenting a safer alternative.",formaldehyde-free benzoxazine monomer,
Analysis of Fluorescent Proteins for Observing Single Gene Locus in a Live and Fixed Escherichia coli Cell,10.1021/acs.jpcb.4c01816,2024,formaldehyde,"The abstract compares formaldehyde fixation with glyoxal fixation and notes that formaldehyde disrupts proper DNA locus observations, whereas glyoxal fixation preserves the foci positions better. This suggests glyoxal as a fixation method with advantages over formaldehyde in this context, implying it is a safer alternative for fixation in gene locus imaging.",glyoxal,
"﻿Mitochondrial genome data provide insights into the phylogenetic relationships within Triplophysadalaica (Kessler, 1876) (Cypriniformes, Nemacheilidae)",10.3897/zookeys.1197.116342,2024,formaldehyde,"The abstract states that ethanol has replaced formalin as the primary preservative for animal specimens due to the detrimental effect of formaldehyde on DNA, implying ethanol is a safer alternative. It explicitly mentions ethanol as a replacement, indicating a safety advantage over formaldehyde/formalin.",ethanol,detrimental effect on DNA
Technical Note – Novel Condensates with High Bio-Based Content as Syntan Replacements,10.34314/kc29s514,2025,formaldehyde,"The abstract clearly states that the novel condensates are made without formaldehyde and bisphenols, using renewable and less toxic starting materials such as vanillin, which avoids toxicity issues. It explicitly positions these condensates as substitutes for syntans that currently contain formaldehyde, indicating a safer alternative to formaldehyde-based syntans.",vanillin,"toxicity, presence of rest-monomeric formaldehyde"
