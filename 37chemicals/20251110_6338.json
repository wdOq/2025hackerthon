    "doi": "10.4058/JSEI.35.198",
    "year": 2020,
    "target": "vinyl chloride",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares the attachment of Bacillus cereus spores on gloves made from various materials, including vinyl chloride, latex, and nitrile rubber. It finds that vinyl chloride gloves have the highest spore attachment, while nitrile rubber gloves have significantly lower spore attachment, and recommends nitrile rubber gloves for medical use. This implies a safety advantage of nitrile rubber gloves over vinyl chloride gloves in terms of contamination risk, which can be reasonably interpreted as a safer alternative to vinyl chloride gloves.",

    "reasoning": "The abstract presents a blend of calcium/zinc stearate and expandable graphite as a heat stabilizer for PVC that is described as nontoxic and environmentally friendly, contrasting with most traditional heat stabilizers that are highly toxic and harmful.
