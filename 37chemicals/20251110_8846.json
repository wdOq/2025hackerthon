    "year": 2022,
    "target": "butyl acrylate",
    "reasoning": "The abstract explicitly compares a novel non-ionic polystyrene-polyurethane (PS-PU) composite latex to traditional styrene-butyl acrylate latex (St-BA), highlighting superior dispersion stability, milder retardation effect, and less adverse impact on compressive strength. The non-ionic nature of PS-PU leads to less destabilization and adsorption, implying improved performance and potentially better safety in cementitious systems compared to St-BA. These points indicate PS-PU as a safer alternative to butyl acrylate-based latex.",

    "reasoning": "The abstract compares poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA), noting that PMEA shows excellent blood compatibility while PBA exhibits poor blood compatibility. This indicates a safety-related advantage of PMEA over PBA, which is a polymer of butyl acrylate. Therefore, PMEA can be reasonably interpreted as a safer alternative to butyl acrylate.",

    "year": 2025,

    "reasoning": "The abstract compares BA/VAc copolymers with and without MDO, showing that MDO-containing formulations biodegrade (12.49% in 60 days) while those without MDO show zero biodegradation. Since butyl acrylate is part of the BA/VAc formulation, the MDO-based formulations can be interpreted as safer alternatives due to their enhanced biodegradability and environmental friendliness. The abstract explicitly highlights MDO-based formulations as more compostable and environmentally friendly, indicating a safety advantage over conventional butyl acrylate-containing polymers.",
