    "year": 2013,
    "target": "Nonylphenol Ethoxylates (NPEs)",
    "reasoning": "The abstract explicitly states that nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) are bioaccumulative, persistent, and produce endocrine-disrupting breakdown products, and that alkyl polyglycoside (APG) surfactants are used as a replacement. This replacement is presented in the context of preparing acrylic polymer latex, implying APG surfactants as a safer alternative to NPEOs due to the environmental and health concerns associated with NPEOs.",
