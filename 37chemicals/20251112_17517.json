    "reasoning": "The abstract compares the resurgence ratios of various insecticides, including Isoprocarb, with Pymetrozine showing a significantly lower resurgence ratio (0.26) compared to Isoprocarb (0.43). This indicates that Pymetrozine is a safer alternative in terms of inducing less resurgence of the brown planthopper, thus suggesting a safety advantage over Isoprocarb.",

It discusses the effects of various insecticides on pest resurgence and yield loss but does not mention toxicity types, endocrine disruption, persistence, bioaccumulation, or occupational hazards related to isoprocarb."
