It also mentions improved safety by avoiding handling sensitive 3-azidooxetane and that poly(3-azidooxetane) is a fully adequate and potentially more environmentally benign substitute compared to epichlorohydrin, indicating a safer alternative to oxirane-based GAP.",

    "target": "oxirane",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares a chemoenzymatic epoxidation method of Karanja oil to conventional chemical methods (implying oxirane-based chemical epoxidation) and states that the enzymatic method is cleaner, greener, and more energy efficient, with 100% selectivity and no side reactions. These points indicate safety advantages over conventional chemical epoxidation, which typically involves oxirane. Therefore, the enzymatic epoxidation method is presented as a safer alternative to oxirane-based chemical epoxidation.",

This indicates these new oxirane carboxylates are safer alternatives to etomoxir, which is an oxirane-containing compound.
