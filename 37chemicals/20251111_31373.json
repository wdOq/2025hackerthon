    "target": "Tetrachloroethylene",
    "reasoning": "The abstract states that mandarin oil, primarily composed of limonene, can replace tetrachloroethylene as a solvent and describes limonene as a safe, non-toxic organic solvent with high performance. This explicitly indicates limonene as a safer alternative to tetrachloroethylene.",

      "harms": [],
      "rationale": "The reasoning text does not explicitly state any harms or hazards related to tetrachloroethylene. It only mentions that mandarin oil can replace benzene, methylbenzene, and tetrachloroethylene as a solvent, and describes limonene as safe and non-toxic, but does not provide any explicit information about the hazards of tetrachloroethylene."
