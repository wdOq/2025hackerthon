    "reasoning": "The abstract compares the toxicity of DEHP, DINP, and DEHT on endothelial cells and reports that all tested plasticizers induced cellular perturbations except for DEHT. This suggests that DEHT has a safer profile in terms of cytotoxicity and mitochondrial effects compared to DEHP, indicating a safety advantage that can be interpreted as a safer alternative.",

    "reasoning": "The abstract explicitly states that ATEC and DL9TH have similar properties to DEHP but do not act as endocrine disruptors, indicating a safety advantage.

It states that only BPA and MEHP (a metabolite of DEHP) significantly decrease testosterone secretion, while some replacements show little toxicity in the fetal rat testis model.
