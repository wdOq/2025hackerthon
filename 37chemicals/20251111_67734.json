    "year": 2020,
    "target": "perfluorohexanesulfonic acid",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares the toxicity of several PFAS including perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and emerging fluoroether PFAS such as GenX, ADONA, and PFESA1. It states that all emerging fluoroether PFAS tested were negative for evaluated developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity outcomes, whereas PFHxS caused developmental neurotoxicity effects. This indicates that these emerging fluoroether PFAS, including GenX, have safety advantages over PFHxS and can be interpreted as safer alternatives.",

    "target": "perfluorohexanesulfonic acid",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares the toxicity of different PFAS compounds, specifically noting that perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) and all perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) did not show similar adverse cytotoxicity as perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). This indicates that PFBS and PFCA have lower reproductive toxicity and thus can be interpreted as safer alternatives to PFHxS.",
