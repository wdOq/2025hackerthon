    "year": 2022,
    "target": "Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA)",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares the genotoxic effects of TBBPA and TBBPS, showing that TBBPS caused the smallest DNA damage and that cells were able to completely repair DNA damage only in the case of TBBPS. This indicates a safety advantage of TBBPS over TBBPA in terms of genotoxicity, suggesting TBBPS as a safer alternative.",

It also mentions potential genotoxic effects and that the damage is likely caused by indirect DNA-damaging agents such as ROS."

    "year": 2020,
    "target": "Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA)",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares the effects of several brominated flame retardants including TBBPA and TBBPS on human proteins. It explicitly states that TBBPA caused the strongest oxidation and structural impairment, while TBBPS had the weakest oxidative effect and did not affect the secondary structure of HSA, indicating a safety advantage. Therefore, TBBPS can be reasonably interpreted as a safer alternative to TBBPA.",

    "year": 2021,
    "target": "Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA)",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares TBBPA and TBBPS, noting that TBBPA causes changes in the erythrocyte membrane at lower concentrations than TBBPS at occupational exposure levels, implying TBBPS has a lower impact/toxicity. It explicitly states TBBPS is used as an alternative to TBBPA due to toxicity concerns. This suggests TBBPS is a safer alternative to TBBPA.",
