    "reasoning": "The abstract explicitly states that inorganic binders (sodium silicate and geopolymer) achieved over 90% reductions in BTEX compounds, including ethylbenzene, compared to organic systems. This indicates a clear safety advantage in terms of lower hazardous emissions, supporting these inorganic binders as safer alternatives to ethylbenzene-containing organic binders.",

    "reasoning": "The abstract compares emissions of harmful gases including ethylbenzene from different types of moulding sands. It states that sands with inorganic binders emit significantly lower amounts of BTEX compounds, including ethylbenzene, compared to sands with organic binders such as furan resin.

This indicates a safety advantage in terms of lower emissions of ethylbenzene when using biodiesel. Therefore, biodiesel is presented as a safer alternative to ethylbenzene-containing diesel fuel.",

It also reports that two substances, 5H-PFO and perfluoro-2-butyltetrahydrofuran, were non-cytotoxic at the highest tested concentrations, suggesting they have lower cytotoxicity than ethylbenzene.
