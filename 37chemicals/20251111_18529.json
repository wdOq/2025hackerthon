    "doi": "10.3390/toxics11010058",
    "year": 2023,
    "target": "Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)",
    "reasoning": "The abstract discusses novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) as alternatives to legacy BFRs including hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs). It reports that NBFRs have lower estimated daily intakes and limited human exposure risk compared to HBCDs, indicating a safety advantage. Therefore, NBFRs are presented as a safer alternative to HBCD.",

It mentions concentrations in dust and compares exposure levels to reference doses, indicating limited human exposure risk at current levels, but does not specify toxicity types, endocrine disruption, persistence, bioaccumulation, or occupational hazards."

    "target": "Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)",
    "reasoning": "The abstract explicitly states that recent flame retardants, such as a butadiene styrene brominated copolymer, are listed by the U.S. EPA as alternatives to hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and are described as safer due to their high molecular weight, reduced migration, and low bioavailability, which minimize exposure and potential harm.",

      "rationale": "The reasoning text does not explicitly state any harms or hazards specifically associated with Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD). It discusses generalizations about flame retardants and mentions that newer flame retardants are designed to be safer, with reduced bioavailability and exposure risk, but does not provide explicit harm information for HBCD itself."

    "year": 2021,
    "target": "Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)",
    "reasoning": "The abstract compares the toxicity of Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) with Tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) and 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), showing that HBCD is more toxic to neural cells than TBBPA and BDE-47. This indicates that TBBPA and BDE-47 have lower toxicity and thus could be considered safer alternatives to HBCD.",
