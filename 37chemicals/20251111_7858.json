    "doi": "10.1124/JPET.104.067330",
    "year": 2004,
    "target": "allyl alcohol",
    "reasoning": "The abstract demonstrates that hydralazine provides strong, dose-dependent protection against hepatotoxicity caused by allyl alcohol in mice, indicating a safety advantage. It explicitly shows hydralazine inactivates reactive adducts formed by allyl alcohol metabolism, thereby preventing liver injury. This supports hydralazine as a safer alternative to allyl alcohol in the context of hepatotoxicity.",

      "rationale": "The reasoning text explicitly states that allyl alcohol is a precursor to acrolein and causes hepatotoxicity in mice, as evidenced by increased plasma liver enzymes (markers of hepatic injury) and depletion of hepatic glutathione. The text also mentions that secondary reactions triggered by reactive carbonyl-retaining protein adducts lead to cellular death."

    "doi": "10.1124/MOL.65.3.655",
    "year": 2004,
    "target": "allyl alcohol",
    "reasoning": "The abstract states that hydralazine strongly diminishes the toxicity of the acrolein precursor allyl alcohol and that its protective potencies correlate with interference in protein modification events caused by acrolein. This indicates hydralazine has safety advantages relative to allyl alcohol toxicity and functions as a cytoprotective agent. Therefore, hydralazine is presented as a safer alternative to allyl alcohol.",
