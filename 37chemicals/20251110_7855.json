    "reasoning": "The abstract mentions that the biotransformation of waste PET can produce novel 3D printing materials as replacements for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). It also states that these approaches potentially enable the manufacturing of environmentally friendly degradable or higher-value high-performance polymers, implying safety advantages over conventional materials like ABS, which contains acrylonitrile. Therefore, it clearly indicates a safer alternative to acrylonitrile-containing materials.",

It highlights that these tobacco-free products are gradually replacing tobacco products that are the main source of acrylonitrile exposure, implying a safety advantage by reducing exposure to acrylonitrile. Thus, NRT products and ECs are presented as safer alternatives to acrylonitrile-containing tobacco products.",

It reports that PLA is low-emitting and ABS is high-emitting, with ABS exposure causing higher levels of exhaled nitric oxide and increased indisposition and odor nuisance.
